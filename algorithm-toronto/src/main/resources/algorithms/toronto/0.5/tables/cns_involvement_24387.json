If Cytospin is not documented, assume there are no blasts in the CSF\n   * If there is no mention of blasts, code blasts as absent\n   * If blasts are referred to as “occasional” or “seen” or similar wording, code blasts are present\n* Red and white blood cell counts from the cerebrospinal fluid  (RBC CSF and WBC CSF) \n  * Lumbar punctures are the most common way to collect this information \n  * If RBC <1/ul,  record as RBC = 0\n  * If WBC <1/uL, record as WBC = 0",
