A normal cell will contain two complete copies of each chromosome, one from each parent, and this normal state is termed heterozygous. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an abnormal state reflecting loss of the whole arm of chromosome 1p following a chromosomal translocation event.\n\n**Note 4:** Other terms for LOH include whole arm loss, gene deletion and allelic loss.",
