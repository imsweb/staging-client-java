  "name": "Adjacent structures",
  "definition": "Connective tissues large enough to be given a specific name would be considered adjacent structures.\nFor example, the brachial artery has a name, as does the broad ligament. In general, continuous tumor\ngrowth from one organ into an adjacent named structure would be coded to ‘2 - Regional by direct\nextension only’ (unless regional lymph nodes were also involved).",
