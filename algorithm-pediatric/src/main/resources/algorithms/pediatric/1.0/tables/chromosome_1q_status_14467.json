  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+.\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, leave this SSDI blank\n\n**Note 2:** Gain of chromosome 1q is one of the most common cytogenetic findings in Wilms tumor, occurring approximately 30% of tumors. It is associated with a poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with favorable (non-anaplastic) histology Wilmâ€™s tumor (FHWT). This testing is commonly done in conjunction with Chromosome 1p: Loss of Heterozygosity (see NAACCR ID: 3801) and Chromosome 16q: Loss of Heterozygosity (see NAACCR ID: 9600).\n* This is a special molecular diagnostic test performed on tumor tissue to identify gain of genetic material normally found on the short arm of one of the patient's two copies of chromosome 1. A normal cell will contain two complete copies of each chromosome, one from each parent, and this normal state is termed heterozygous. Gain of heterozygosity (GOH) is an abnormal state reflecting gain of the whole arm of chromosome 1q following a chromosomal translocation event\n* Primary sources of information: molecular pathology report (may be addendum to original pathology report)\n\n**Note 3:** Physician statement of Chromosome 1q gain can be used to code this data item.",
