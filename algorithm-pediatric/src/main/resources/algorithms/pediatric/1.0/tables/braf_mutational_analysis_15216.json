  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, leave this SSDI blank\n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of BRAF can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** BRAF is a gene which belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Studies suggest that BRAF gene mutations are often present in Astrocytoma. The most common BRAF mutations are\n* BRAF V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation\n* BRAF KIAA1549\n\n**Note 4:** The most common testing methods for BRAF are\n* Direct Sanger sequencing\n* High-resolution melting analysis\n* Pyrosequencing\n* Real-time PCR\n\n**Note 5:** If BRAF is positive and there is no mention of the mutated codon, or the mutated codon is not specified, code 4.\n\n**Note 6:** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no BRAF results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens",
