These IDRF’s are based on imaging prior to any surgical resection or other treatment. \n * Ipsilateral tumor extension within two body compartments\n   - Neck-chest, chest-abdomen, abdomen-pelvis\n\n* Neck\n   - Tumor encasing carotid and/or vertebral artery and/or internal jugular vein\n   - Tumor extending to base of skull\n   - Tumor compressing the trachea\n* Cervico-thoracic junction\n   - Tumor encasing brachial plexus roots\n   - Tumor encasing subclavian vessels and/or vertebral and/or carotid artery\n   - Tumor compressing the trachea\n* Thorax\n   -  Tumor encasing the aorta and/or major branches\n   - Tumor compressing the trachea and/or principal bronchi\n   - Lower mediastinal tumor, infiltrating the costovertebral junction between T9 and T12\n* Thoraco-abdominal\n   - Tumor encasing the aorta and/or vena cava\n* Abdomen, pelvis \n   - Tumor infiltrating the porta hepatis and/or the hepatoduodenal ligament\n   - Tumor encasing branches of the superior mesenteric artery at the mesenteric root\n   - Tumor encasing the origin of the coeliac axis, and/or of the superior mesenteric artery\n   - Tumor invading one or both renal pedicles\n   - Tumor encasing the aorta and/or vena cava\n   - Tumor encasing the iliac vessels\n   - Pelvic tumor crossing sciatic notch\n* Intraspinal tumor extension whatever the location provided that\n   - More than one third of the spinal canal in the axial plane is invaded and/or the perimedullary leptomeningeal spaces are not visible and/or the spinal cord signal is abnormal \n* Infiltration of adjacent organs/structures\n   - Pericardium, diaphragm, kidney, liver, duodeno-pancreatic block, and mesentery \n\n**Note 4:** Ascites and/or a pleural effusion, even with malignant cells, do not constitute metastatic disease unless they are remote from the body compartment of the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 5:** Regional lymph node involvement does not factor into staging\n* Code 3 for non-regional lymph node involvement (distant lymph nodes)",
