  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This field records the clinically or cytologically confirmed involvement of the Central Nervous System at diagnosis or during the initial workup of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in pediatric patients. CNS involvement at diagnosis or at relapse is a significant cause of treatment failure and treatment-related morbidity.\n* Use the following resources to find information on CNS involvement: imaging, laboratory reports, CSF lactate dehydrogenase (LD, LDH) test\n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of CNS Involvement can be used to code this data item. \n\n**Note 3:** Criteria for CNS Involvement\n* Clinical signs of CNS involvement\n   * Radiologic evidence of intracranial, intradural mass\n   * Cranial nerve palsy (e.g. facial weakness, ptosis), brain/eye involvement or hypothalamic syndrome\n    * **Note:** Extra-ocular orbital masses, severe headaches and eye swelling (in the absence of signs of cranial nerve involvement) are **not** sufficient to constitute clinical evidence of CNS involvement\n* The presence of blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\n   * Cytospin is required to determine the presence or absence of blasts in the CSF. \n      * If Cytospin is not documented, then the presence of blasts cannot be determined. CNS involvement would be unknown (code 9) unless there are clinical statements of CNS Involvement **OR the physician documents a stage**\n   * If Cytospin is documented and there is no mention of blasts, code blasts as absent\n   * If blasts are referred to as “occasional” or “seen” or similar wording, code blasts as present\n* Red and white blood cell counts from the cerebrospinal fluid (RBC CSF and WBC CSF) \n  * Lumbar punctures are the most common way to collect this information \n  * If RBC <1/ul,  record as RBC = 0\n  * If WBC <1/uL, record as WBC = 0",
