  "description" : "The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Prognostic Classification (INPC) categorizes neuroblastomas as favorable or unfavorable histologies based on the following factors: age, neuroblastic maturation, Schwannian stromal content, Mitosis-kayorrhexis index (MKI), and degree of differentiation (grade). \n\nThe International Neuroblastoma Pathology Prognostic Classification (INPC) (unfavorable versus favorable histology) is a biologically relevant classification based on morphologic features of neuroblastic tumors which has prognostic indications. It is based on the following criteria.\n* Age\n* Neuroblastic maturation\n* Schwannian stromal content\n* Mitosis-kayorrhexis index (MKI)\n* Degree of differentiation (grade)",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, this SSDI must be blank\n\n**Note 2:** **Physician statement**\n* Physician statement of unfavorable vs favorable histology can be used to code this data item when no other information is available, provided there is information that the results are from a biopsy or surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n**Note 3:** **Neoadjuvant Therapy**\n* The INPC results are to be coded based on either biopsy or surgical resection (without neoadjuvant therapy).\n* **Code 9** if the only results are from a post neoadjuvant surgical resection",
