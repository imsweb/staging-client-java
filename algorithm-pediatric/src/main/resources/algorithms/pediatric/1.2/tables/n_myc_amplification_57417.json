  "description" : "n-MYC Amplification is a gene that normally regulates cell growth. Studies have shown that n-MYC amplification is an indicator of poor prognosis and increased risk of unfavorable outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma.\n\nThis field indicates the n-MYC status of a neuroblastoma tumor after a pathologic specimen is obtained.",
