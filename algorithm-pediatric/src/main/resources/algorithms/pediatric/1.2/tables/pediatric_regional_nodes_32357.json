For this Pediatric Schema, if there is no mention of lymph node involvement clinically, assume that lymph nodes are negative. Code 999 (unknown) only when there is no available information on the patientâ€™s disease, for example when a lab only case is abstracted from a biopsy report and no clinical information is provided.",
