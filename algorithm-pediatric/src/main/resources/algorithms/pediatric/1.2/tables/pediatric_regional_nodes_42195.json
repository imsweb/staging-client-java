  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in Pediatric Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n* **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 300) are used when there is a clinical work up only and there is no surgical resection of the primary tumor or site. This includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, or lymph node excision \n   - *Exception:* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment code would take priority\n* **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (200, 400, 500) are used when \n   - Primary tumor or site surgically resected with \n      + Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes. Includes \n         + FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up and/or\n         + Lymph node dissection performed\n* Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological information.\n\n**Note 3:** Involvement of inguinal, pelvic, or external iliac lymph nodes WITHOUT or unknown if previous scrotal or inguinal surgery prior to presentation of the testis tumor is coded in Pediatric Mets as distant lymph node involvement.\n\n**Note 4:** Regional lymph nodes include:\nAortic, NOS\n* Lateral (lumbar)\n* Para-aortic\n* Periaortic\n* Preaortic\n* Retroaortic\n\nPericaval, NOS\n* Interaortocaval\n* Paracaval\n* Precaval\n* Retrocaval\n\nRetroperitoneal below the diaphragm or NOS\nSpermatic vein\n\nLymph nodes **WITH** previous scrotal or inguinal surgery\n* External iliac\n* Inguinal nodes, NOS\n   - Deep, NOS\n   - Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n   - Superficial (femoral)\n* Pelvic\n\n**Note 5:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
