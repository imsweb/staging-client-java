  "description" : "PRETEXT stands for PRE-Treatment Extent of tumor. This field describes the extent of involvement within the four lobes of the liver at time of a pediatric liver tumor diagnosis. It is based off clinical imaging and was originally designed to standardize imaging evaluation and risk stratification of hepatoblastoma before neoadjuvant chemotherapy or tumor resection.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, this SSDI must be blank\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for coding**\n* This SSDI is based on imaging findings only. **Do not** code any findings from surgical resection in this data item. Evaluation must also be done prior to any neoadjuvant therapy\n\n**Note 3:** **Pretext Staging-Segments of the liver**\n* Caudate liver: Segment I \n**Note:** Involvement of the caudate liver is at minimum Stage 2\n* Left lateral section: Segments II & III\n* Left medial section: Segments IVA & IVB\n* Right anterior section: Segments V & VIII\n* Right posterior section: Segments VI & VII",

  "rationale" : "After initially being created by the International Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group (SIOPEL) in 1990, PRETEXT was introduced for use within the United States in 2014 by the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group (COG) once radiographic imaging became more sophisticated and exploratory surgery at diagnosis was no longer advisable. It is used as a central component of risk stratification schemes that define treatment of hepatoblastoma."
