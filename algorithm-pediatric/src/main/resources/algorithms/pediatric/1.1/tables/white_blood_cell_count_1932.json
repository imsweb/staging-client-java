  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, leave this SSDI blank\n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of WBC (White Blood Cell Count) Pretreatment Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n* Record the lab value of the highest WBC test result documented in the medical record **prior to treatment**. The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report\n* Record to the nearest cells per microliter (cells/uL) the highest WBC lab value documented in the medical record **prior to treatment**. \n* A known lab value takes priority over codes XXXXX.2-XXXXX.4\n    - The lab value takes priority even if the physician documents the interpretation\n      *Example:* Patient noted to have a WBC count of 60,000. Physician notes that the value is elevated. \n      Code 60,000 instead of XXXXX.4 (elevated)\n\n**Note 3:** The measurement used for this data item is “cells/mm3”, which is the same as “cells/uL”. If your facility has a different measurement, here are examples of the conversions to cells/m3. \n\n*Examples:* \n* Reported as 3650 cells/uL. Record as 3650.0\n* Reported as 3.55 k/uL. Record as 3550.0 (multiply x 1000)\n* Reported as 4.25 10^3/uL. Record as 4250.0 (multiply x 1000)\n* Reported as 6.35 K/mm3.  Record as 6350.0 (multiply x 1000)",
