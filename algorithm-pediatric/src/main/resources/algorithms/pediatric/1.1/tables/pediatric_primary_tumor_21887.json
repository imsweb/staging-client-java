  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Any mention of the terms including fixed, matted, mass in the hilum, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and/or mesentery, palpable, enlarged, shotty, lymphadenopathy are all regarded as involvement for lymphomas when determining appropriate code.\n\n**Note 2:** St. Jude/Murphy staging is based primarily on the primary site where certain primary sites or sites of involvement may only be assigned specific codes. The list below provides guidance on which codes to use based on the primary site and/or other involvement.\n* Codes based on primary site\n  * Abdomen (C239, C240-C249, C250-C259, C422, C493-C494, C480-C488, C649, C659, C669, C762, C772), then only code 400 may be assigned\n   * GI Tract (C160-C218, C260-C269), then only codes 200 or 400 may be assigned\n   * Paraspinal or epidural sites (C470-C479), then only code 400 may be assigned\n    * Primary intrathoracic tumors (mediastinal, hilar, pulmonary, pleural, or thymic) (C340-C349, C379, C381-C388, C771, then only code 400 may be assigned\n* Codes based on involvement\n  * Code 600 for liver involvement (including primary site C220)\n  * Code 800 for bone marrow (including primary site C421), or peripheral blood involvement\n   * Code 800 for CNS involvement (including primary sites C700-C729)\n* ALL sites except those noted above, codes 100, 300, 500-800, 999 may be assigned based on involvement\n\n**Note 3:** Extensive disease (code 400) typically exhibits spread to para-aortic and retroperitoneal areas by implants and plaques in mesentery or peritoneum, or by direct infiltration of structures adjacent to the primary tumor. Ascites may be present, and complete resection of all gross tumor is not possible.\n\n**Note 4:** Code 888 for histologies 9731, 9732, and 9734\n* St Jude/Murphy staging is not applicable for Plasmacytomas (9731, 9734) and Plasma Cell Myeloma (9732)",
