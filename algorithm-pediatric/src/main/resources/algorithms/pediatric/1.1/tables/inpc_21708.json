It is based on the following criteria\n* Age\n* Neuroblastic maturation\n* Schwannian stromal content\n* Mitosis-kayorrhexis index (MKI)\n* Degree of differentiation (grade)\n\n**Note 3:** The INPC results are to be coded based on either biopsy or surgical resection (without neoadjuvant therapy). If the only results are from a post neoadjuvant surgical resection, code 9. \n\n**Note 4:**  Physician statement of unfavorable vs favorable histology can be used to code this data item when no other information is available, provided there is information that the results are from a biopsy or surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy.",
