  "description" : "The BRAF oncoprotein is involved in transmitting cell growth and proliferation signals from KRAS and NRAS. The BRAF V600E mutation is associated with poorer prognosis and predicts lack of response to anti-EGFR therapies.  \n“BRAF V600E is a specific mutation (change) in the BRAF gene, which makes a protein that is involved in sending signals in cells and in cell growth. This BRAF gene mutation is found in colorectal cancer. It may increase the growth and spread of cancer cells. Checking for this BRAF mutation in tumor tissue may help to plan cancer treatment. BRAF (V600E) kinase inhibitor RO5185426 blocks certain proteins made by the mutated BRAF gene, which may help keep cancer cells from growing.” (NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms  https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms)\n\nThe most common testing methods for BRAF are\n* Direct Sanger sequencing\n* High-resolution melting analysis\n* Pyrosequencing\n* PCR, allele-specific hybridization\n* Real-time PCR\n\nThe most common BRAF mutations is BRAF V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, this SSDI must be blank\n\n**Note 2:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of BRAF can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** **Applicable stages**\n* BRAF may be recorded for all stages; however, it is primarily performed for patients with metastatic disease. If information is not available, code 9.\n\n**Note 4:** **Results from nodal or metastatic tissue**\n* Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used for BRAF.\n\n**Note 5:** **Neoadjuvant Therapy** \n* Record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no BRAF results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.",
