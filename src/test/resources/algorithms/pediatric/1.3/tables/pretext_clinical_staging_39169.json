  "description" : "PRETEXT stands for PRE-Treatment Extent of tumor. This field describes the extent of involvement within the four lobes of the liver at time of a pediatric liver tumor diagnosis. It is based off clinical imaging and was originally designed to standardize imaging evaluation and risk stratification of hepatoblastoma before neoadjuvant chemotherapy or tumor resection.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2023, this SSDI must be blank\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for coding**\n* This SSDI is based on imaging findings only. **Do not** code any findings from surgical resection in this data item. Evaluation must also be done prior to any neoadjuvant therapy\n\n**Note 3:** **Pretext Staging-Segments of the liver**\n* Caudate liver: Segment I \n**Note:** Involvement of the caudate liver is at minimum Stage 2\n* Left lateral section: Segments II & III\n* Left medial section: Segments IVA & IVB\n* Right anterior section: Segments V & VIII\n* Right posterior section: Segments VI & VII",

  "rationale" : "After initially being created by the International Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group (SIOPEL) in 1990, PRETEXT was introduced for use within the United States in 2014 by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) once radiographic imaging became more sophisticated and exploratory surgery at diagnosis was no longer advisable. It is used as a central component of risk stratification schemes that define treatment of hepatoblastoma."
