  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Osseous plasmacytomas** \n* Osseous (medullary) plasmacytoma (9731) is a **single**, localized tumor occurring in the bone. \n* There may be soft tissue extension.\n\n**Note 2:** **Extraosseous plasmacytomas** \n* Extraosseous (extramedullary) plasmacytoma (9734) is a **single**, localized tumor that arises in tissue other than bone. \n* The most common sites are the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, bladder, central nervous system (CNS), breast, thyroid, testis and skin.\n\n**Note 3:** **Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma** \n* Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (9671) and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (9761) are now collected with the plasma cell disorders. These are systemic diseases and should always be coded 700.\n\n**Note 4:** **Multiple plasmacytomas** \n* Per the 2024 WHO Classification of Tumours, Haematolymphoid Tumours, 5th edition, ***a plasmacytoma is defined as a single lesion.*** \n* If there are multiple lesions/plasmacytomas, this is diagnostic of plasma cell myeloma (9732/3) and the Plasma Cell Myeloma Schema should be used to assign EOD.",
