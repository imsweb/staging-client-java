This data item captures clinically important brain cancer subtypes identified by molecular markers that are not distinguishable by ICD-O-3 codes.\n\nOnly one code is applicable for each tumor. \n* *IDH mutation status* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 **9400/3**, Diffuse astrocytoma and **9401/3**, Anaplastic astrocytoma.\n* *IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deletion* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 code **9450/3**, Oligodendroglioma and **9451/3**, Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.\n* *IDH-wildtype* distinguishes clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 **9400/3**, Diffuse astrocytoma, **9401/3**, Anaplastic astrocytoma and **9440/3**, Glioblastoma, Epithelioid glioblastoma and Glioblastoma, NOS (note that the new ICD-O-3 code **9445/3** applies to Glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; information regarding this subtype is not collected using this data item).\n* *SHH-activation and TP53-wildtype* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 histology code **9471/3**, Medulloblastoma. \n* *C19MC alteration status* distinguishes a clinically important highly aggressive subtype within ICD-O-3 **9478/3**, Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes.",
