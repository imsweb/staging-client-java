  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Regional nodes and nodes, NOS**  \n* Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n\n**No surgical resection**\n* Use **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 200, 600, 650) when there is a clinical work up only and there is **NO surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision, or lymph node dissection done during the clinical work up.\n\n**Surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy**\n* Use **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (300, 350, 400, 500, 700, 750) when there is a **surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision done or lymph node dissection performed.\n\n**Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy**\n* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is equal to or greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment codes take priority. Otherwise, code the pathologic assessment.\n  * See ***EOD 2018 General Instructions*** for further instructions on coding cases with neoadjuvant therapy, https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/staging/eod/.\n\n**Note 3:** **Isolated tumor cells** \n* Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. \n* ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction).\n  * Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 4:** **In transit metastasis** \n* In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph node(s) or distal to the primary lesion. \n* In transit metastasis with positive lymph node(s) are coded under regional lymph nodes.\n* Code 600 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 650 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 700 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 750 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n\n**Note 5:** **Regional lymph nodes for skin**\n* Single, Multiple, Ipsilateral, Bilateral or Contralateral lymph nodes\n\n**Skin of head and neck (C000-C006, C008-C009, C440-C444)**\n- Levels I-VII \n- Axillary (neck only, C444)\n- Cervical, NOS\n- Deep cervical, NOS\n- Facial (buccinator, buccal, nasolabial)\n- Internal jugular, NOS\n- Parapharyngeal \n- Parotid (infraauricular, intraparotid, periparotid, preauricular)\n- Retroauricular (mastoid)\n- Retropharyngeal\n- Suboccipital\n\n**Skin of trunk (C445)**\n- Upper trunk \n  + Axillary\n  + Cervical\n  + Internal mammary\n  + Supraclavicular\n- Lower trunk \n  + Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Skin of upper limb and shoulder (C446)**\n- Axillary\n- Cervical\n- Epitrochlear for hand/forearm\n- Internal mammary (parasternal)\n- Spinal accessory for shoulder\n- Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n\n**Skin of lower limb and hip (C447)**\n- Femoral (superficial inguinal)\n- Inguinal\n- Popliteal for heel and calf\n\n**Vulva (C510-C512, C518-C519)**\n- Deep inguinal, NOS\n- Femoral\n- Inguinal, NOS\n- Inguinofemoral (groin)\n- Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n- Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Penis (C600-C602, C608-C609)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Scrotum (C632)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n        * Obturator\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Deep inguinal, NOS\n        * Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Note 6:** **Lymph nodes, NOS** \n* Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
