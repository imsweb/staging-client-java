  "description" : "This data item describes the method used to assess involvement of Distant (mediastinal, scalene) nodes associated with certain female genital cancers.\n\nIn addition to assigning the N categories for vulva, vagina, and cervical cancers, the collection of specific lymph nodes and how they were assessed is important.\n* Status refers to positive or negative involvement\n* Assessment is the method by which the nodal status was determined\n\nThere are 3 related data items that collect assessment method information on regional lymph nodes, and 1 data item for distant lymph nodes. \n\nThe LN assessment data items collect how the lymph nodes were assessed for femoral-inguinal, para-aortic, and pelvic lymph nodes, and distant lymph nodes scalene and mediastinal. These related data items include\n* 3871: LN Assessment Method Femoral-Inguinal\n* 3872: LN Assessment Method Para-Aortic\n* 3873: LN Assessment Method Pelvic\n* 3874: LN Distant Assessment Method",
