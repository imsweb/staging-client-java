  "description" : "KIT Gene Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the expression of the KIT gene in tumor tissue specimens based on immunohistochemical (IHC) stains.  A positive test is a diagnostic and predictive marker for GIST tumors.\n\nKIT is a gene that regulates cell growth and differentiation. Mutations of this gene become oncogenes and cause a gastrointestinal stromal tumor to ignore cellular control signals. About 85-90% of GIST tumors contain oncogenic mutations of the KIT receptor gene. KIT immunohistochemistry is a special immunofluorescent stain that turns mutated cells brown and confirms a diagnosis of GIST. The presence of the KIT gene also indicates that the patient may respond to Gleevec or Sutent.",
