  "description" : "Number of Positive Pelvic Nodes is the number of positive nodes based on pelvic nodal dissection.\n\nFor the Corpus schemas (3) and the Cervix Sarcoma schema, there are 4 data items that record information on the number of positive and examined para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. These related data items should be coded from the same procedure\n* 3899: Number of Examined Para-Aortic Nodes\n* 3900: Number of Examined Pelvic Nodes\n* 3901: Number of Positive Para-Aortic Nodes\n* 3902: Number of Positive Pelvic Nodes",

Add these two together to get the total number of positive nodes. \n\n**Note 5:** **Related data item**\n* The number of examined pelvic nodes is recorded in the related data item 3900: Number of Examined Pelvic Nodes.",
