  "description" : "The absence or presence of PD-L1 expression determines if the tumor will respond to treatment with a targeted inhibitor (immunotherapy). PD-L1 is done for Non-Small Cell lung cancers (NSCLC).\n\nThis test is usually done on metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. An assay is performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimen of at least 100 cells taken from the patient. The assay is used to determine the PD-L1 expression by IHC. Then the pathologist determines the tumor proportion score. The treating physician uses that information to determine what type of treatment the patient will receive.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2025+\n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2024, this SSDI must be blank\n\n**Note 2:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement PD-L1 can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** **Purpose of PD-L1** \n* The absence or presence of PD-L1 expression determines if the tumor will respond to treatment with a targeted inhibitor (immunotherapy). PD-L1 is done for Non-Small Cell lung cancers (NSCLC). \n\n**Note 4:** **Tumor Proportion Score**\n* PD-L1 is documented by the tumor proportion score. Record the actual Tumor Proportion Score (0.0-100.0) as stated from the pathology report.\n* An actual tumor proportion score (0.1-100.0) takes priority over XXX.2 (Stated as negative), XXX.3 (Stated as low), or XXX.4 (Stated as high/positive)\n\n**Note 5:** **Combined Proportion Score (CPS)**\n* Do not record the CPS score (0.0-100.0) in this data item. \n  * If you have a CPS score WITH an interpretation, record the interpretation. \n     * ***Example:*** Squamous cell carcinoma: NEGATIVE for PD-L1 Expression, CPS score <1. Record as XXX.2 for negative\n   * If you have a CPS score WITHOUT an interpretation, record unknown (XXX.9). \n     * ***Example:*** Squamous cell carcinoma: PD-L1, CPS score <1. Record as XXX.9 for unknown (interpretation not provided)\n\n**Note 6:** **Neoadjuvant therapy** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy. \n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no PD-L1 results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens",
