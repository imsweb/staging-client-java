  "description" : "Multigene signatures or classifiers are assays of a panel of genes from a tumor specimen, intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of response to chemotherapy and to evaluate prognosis or the likelihood of future metastasis. This data item identifies the multigene signature result.  Oncotype Dx is coded elsewhere.",

The same test should be used to record the related data item 3894: Multigene Signature Method.\n\n**Note 3:** **Oncotype Dx tests** \n* Oncotype Dx tests are not recorded in this data item. See the following related data items for Oncotype Dx.\n  * 3903: Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS\n  * 3904: Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-Invasive\n  * 3905: Oncotype Dx Risk Level-DCIS\n  * 3906: Oncotype Dx Risk Level-Invasive",
