  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Regional nodes and nodes, NOS**  \n* Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **Coding no regional lymph node involvement** \n* Code 000 may be used when\n  * Pathology report **only** with a localized tumor based on Breslow's depth and/or Clark's Level (see EOD Primary Tumor or Summary Stage) AND\n  * No information on regional lymph nodes or mets\n    * **Note:** If the tumor is noted to be regional or distant based on Breslow’s Depth and/or Clark’s (see EOD Primary Tumor, EOD Mets or Summary Stage) then you cannot assume that the nodes are negative and would need to assign 999. \n\n**Note 3:** **Criteria for coding nodes** \n* Codes 100-750 are based on the following criteria\n  + How the nodes were determined\n     * Clinically occult (not clinically apparent) and found to be positive on microscopic examination (e.g., on sentinel lymph node procedure)\n     * Clinically detected (clinically apparent) WITH or WITHOUT microscopic confirmation\n   + Number of nodes involved\n   + Presence of in-transit, satellite or microsatellite mets (see Note 4)\n\n**Note 4:** **Isolated tumor cells** \n* Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. \nITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction). \n* Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 5:** **In-transit, satellite and/r microsatellite metastasis** \n* In-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis are metastasis that have occurred via lymphatic or angiolymphatic spread. \n* Satellite nodules are subcutaneous metastasis that occur within 2 cm of the primary tumor. \n* Microsatellite metastasis are microscopic cutaneous metastasis found adjacent or deep to a primary melanoma tumor.\n  * Code 300 if there are in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n  * Code 500 if there are in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis WITH 1 positive lymph node\n  * Code 700 if there are in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis WITH 2 or more positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 6:** **Bilateral or contralateral nodes** \n* Bilateral or contralateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy. \n* Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.\n   * Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 7:** **Nodal basins** \n* Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins and are coded as regional nodes. \n\n**Note 8:** **Regional lymph nodes for skin**\n* Single, Multiple, Ipsilateral, Bilateral or Contralateral lymph nodes\n\n**Skin of head and neck (C000-C002, C006, C440-C444)**\n- Levels I-VII \n- Axillary (neck only, C444)\n- Cervical, NOS\n- Deep cervical, NOS\n- Facial (buccinator, buccal, nasolabial)\n- Internal jugular, NOS\n- Parapharyngeal \n- Parotid (infraauricular, intraparotid, periparotid, preauricular)\n- Retroauricular (mastoid)\n- Retropharyngeal\n- Suboccipital\n\n**Skin of trunk (C445)**\n* Upper trunk\n  * Axillary\n  * Cervical\n  * Internal mammary\n   * Supraclavicular\n* Lower trunk\n   * Superficial inguinal (femoral) \n\n\n**Skin of upper limb and shoulder (C446)**\n- Axillary\n- Cervical\n- Epitrochlear for hand/forearm\n- Internal mammary (parasternal)\n- Spinal accessory for shoulder\n- Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n\n**Skin of lower limb and hip (C447)**\n- Femoral (superficial inguinal)\n- Inguinal \n- Popliteal for heel and calf\n\n**Vulva (C510-C512, C518-C519)**\n- Deep inguinal, NOS\n- Femoral\n- Inguinal, NOS\n- Inguinofemoral (groin)\n- Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n- Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Penis (C600-C602, C608-C609)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Scrotum (C632)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n        * Obturator\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Deep inguinal, NOS\n        * Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Note 9:** **Lymph nodes, NOS** \n* Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
