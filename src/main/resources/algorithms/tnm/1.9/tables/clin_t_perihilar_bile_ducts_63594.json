  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Perihilar bile duct tumors arise at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts in the hilar area of the liver.\n\n**Note 2:**  The biliary radicals are the ducts or tubes that drain bile into the intestine as part of the digestive process.  The second-order biliary radicals are the next largest branches or ducts of the biliary system which join to form or empty into the main hepatic bile duct.\n\n**Note 3:**  T3 and T4 are defined strictly in terms of invasion into specific large blood vessels and the biliary radicals within the liver.  Assign T4  when the specified vessels and/or the biliary radical within the liver plus other named organs are involved. \n\n**Note 4:**  Involvement within the porta hepatis is coded according to the structures involved: portal vein, common hepatic artery, and common hepatic duct.",
