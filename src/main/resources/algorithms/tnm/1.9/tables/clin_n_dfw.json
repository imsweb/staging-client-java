Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:** Bilateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  \n* Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 3:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are regional for TNM staging. \n\n**Note 4:** In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion.\n* In transit metastasis is coded in N (regional lymph nodes)\n\n**Note 5:** Code isolated tumor cells (ITCs) as positive nodes.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n\n    Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) only\n\n    Regional lymph nodes (unilateral or bilateral)\n    Iliac, NOS\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n            Obturator\n    Inguinal, NOS\n        Deep inguinal, NOS\n            Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n        Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n    Pelvic nodes in contiguous or secondary nodal basin\n\n    Regional lymph node(s), NOS",
