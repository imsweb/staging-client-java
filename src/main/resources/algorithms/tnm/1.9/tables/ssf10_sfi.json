  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Cholangiocarcinoma may be classified by growth pattern. The tumor growth patterns of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include the mass forming type, the periductal infiltrating type, and a mixed type.  The periductal infiltrating type of cholangiocarcinoma demonstrates a diffuse longitudinal growth pattern along the bile duct.  Limited analyses suggest that the diffuse periductal infiltrating type is associated with a poor prognosis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the presence or absence of an infiltrating periductal component.  This information may be obtained from radiology, surgery, or pathology reports. \n\n**Note 3:**  Only code absence of periductal component if a physician states that periductal component is not present or if the tumor is described as mass-forming only.  \n* If diagnostic and/or treatment records are not available, record 999 for unknown",
