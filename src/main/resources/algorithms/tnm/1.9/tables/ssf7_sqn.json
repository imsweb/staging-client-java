Morular growth pattern refers to well-defined, circumscribed, solid round nests of cells that fill and expand endometrial glands.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code based on the percentage of non-endometrioid cell type as stated on the pathology report.  Only use a statement of Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3 if it is based on the growth pattern.  \n* If grade based on growth pattern is not specified, use code 999",
