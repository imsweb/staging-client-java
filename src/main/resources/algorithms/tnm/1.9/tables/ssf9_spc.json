Do not code extracapsular extension for any distant lymph node(s).\n\n**Note 3:**  If nodes are involved pathologically but there is no statement of extranodal extension in the pathology report, use code 010.\n\n**Note 4:**  Code microscopic or macroscropic extranodal extension as stated in the final diagnosis of the pathology report. If not stated in the final diagnosis, code microscopic if extranodal extension is described only in the microscopic section of the pathology report and macroscopic if extranodal extension is described in the gross section of the pathology report. Macroscopic extension takes priority over microscopic extension.\n\n**Note 5:**  Use code 040 if pathologic extracapsular extension is described with no further information and the pathology report is not available for review.",
