  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Chromoganins are a family of proteins in secretory granules found throughout the neuroendocrine system. Serum Chromogranin A (CgA) has been shown to be a useful marker for neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record to the nearest nanogram/milliliter (ng/ml) the highest CgA lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment.  \n* For example, code a pretreatment CgA of 400 ng/ml as 400\n\n**Note 3:**  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 ng/ml (no measurable amount of CgA).  Do not round tiny values down to 0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 1 ng/ml should be coded 001.  \n* For code 001, also round 1.1 - 1.4 ng/ml down to 1 ng/ml\n* For codes 002-979, round values to the nearest ng/ml\n\n**Note 4:**  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  \n* For example, code a value stated as \"less than 5 ng/ml\" as 005",
