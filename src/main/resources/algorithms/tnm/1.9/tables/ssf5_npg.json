The location of the tumor's distal edge within the esophagus may be described based on imaging, esophagoscopy, or surgical results.\n\n**Note 2:**   Record the distance from the incisors to the distal edge of tumor to the nearest centimeter (cm).\n\n**Note 3:**  Calculate the distance to the distal edge of tumor if the distance to the proximal edge and the length of the tumor is known.",
