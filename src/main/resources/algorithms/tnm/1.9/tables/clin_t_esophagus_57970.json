  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Non-invasive carcinomas in the esophagus formerly called in situ are now called high grade dysplasia. High grade dysplasia and severe dysplasia are generally not reportable in cancer registries. \n* Assign pTis if your registry collects these tumors\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of esophagus or to cardia of stomach and code depth of invasion or extra-esophageal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:**  The three layers of the mucosa (epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae) may be called the m1, m2, and m3 layers.  The submucosa may be described as having inner, middle, and outer thirds called sm1, sm2, and sm3.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the tumor's extension is only described by a phrase like \"through the muscularis propria\", this could mean that the cancer has penetrated the outermost muscle cells but not beyond (T2); but usually \"through the muscularis\" is used to indicate that the cancer extends beyond the muscle and into adjacent tissue, consistent with a T3 tumor.  When the most specific description is a phrase like \"through the muscularis\" or \"through the esophageal wall\", then assign T3.",
