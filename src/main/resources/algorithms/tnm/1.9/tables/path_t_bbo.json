TNM does not include an in situ category for prostate tumors.\n\n**Note 2:** T1 (T1a, T1b, T1c and T1 [NOS]) are only used for clinical evaluation of prostate tumors.  \n\n**Note 3:** When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), assign the appropriate T category for the extent of disease found (for example, involvement in one lobe, both lobes, or more)\n\n**Note 4:** When the apical margin, distal urethral margin, bladder base margin, or bladder neck margin is involved and there is no extracapsular extension, assign pT2.\n\n**Note 5:** Invasion into the prostatic apex or into (but not beyond) the prostatic capsule is not classified as T3, but as T2",
