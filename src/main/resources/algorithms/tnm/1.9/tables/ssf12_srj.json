  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Carcinoid tumors can release large amounts of serotonin.  5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid  (5-HIAA) is a breakdown product of the hormone serotonin.  The 5-HIAA test measures the amount of acid secreted in the urine over a 24-hour period.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record to the nearest milligram (mg) the highest 5-HIAA lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment. \n* For example, code a pre-treatment 5-HIAA of 550 mg over 24 hours as 550\n\n**Note 3:**  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0 mg (no measurable amount of 5-HIAA).  Do not round tiny values down to 0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 1 mg should be coded 001.  \n* For code 001, also round 1.1 - 1.4 mg down to 1 ng/ml\n* For codes 002-979, round values to the nearest mg\n\n**Note 4:**  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  \n* For example, code a value stated as \"less than 5 mg\" as 005",
