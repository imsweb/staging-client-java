  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Only peripheral lymph nodes are assessed which include the cervical, supraclavicular, epitrochlear, axillary, and inguinal nodal groups.\n* Clinically abnormal peripheral lymph node(s) is defined as any palpable peripheral node that on physical examination is firm, irregular, clustered, fixed, or 1.5 centimeter (cm) or larger in diameter\n* Central nodes, which are not generally amenable to pathologic assessment, are not currently classified in the nodal classification unless used to establish N3 histopathologically\n\n**Note 2:**  Dutch grade system includes\n\n    Grade 1 - Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy (DL)\n    Grade 2 - Early involvement by mycosis fungoides (MF), (presence of cerebriform nuclei larger than 7.5 micrometers (um)\n    Grade 3 - Partial effacement of lymph node architecture; many atypical cerebriform mononuclear cells (CMCs)\n    Grade 4 - Complete effacement of lymph node architecture\n\n**Note 3:**  National Cancer Institute - Lymph Nodes (NCI LN) grade system includes\n\n    LN0 - No atypical lymphocytes\n    LN1 - Occasional and isolated atypical lymphocytes not arranged in clusters\n    LN2 - Many atypical lymphocytes or in 3-6 cell clusters\n    LN3 - Aggregates of atypical lymphocytes; nodal architecture preserved\n    LN4 - Partial/complete effacement of nodal architecture by atypical lymphocytes or frankly neoplastic cells\n\n**Note 4:**  A T-cell clone (clone negative or clone positive) is defined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor gene. \n\n**Note 5:**  For this site, code all lymph node(s) (regional and distant) involvement in this field.",
