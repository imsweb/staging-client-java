  "notes" : "**Note 1:** The International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been developed for lymphomas and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 60 years \n* Ann Arbor Stage III or IV\n* More than 1 extranodal site involved \n* Patient's performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) 2, 3, or 4\n* Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level\n\n**Note 2:** Record the IPI as stated in the medical record. Do not calculate points or assign risk. Only record points or risk if a physician has documented them. Use points over risk if both are available.\n\n**Note 3:**  There are now three indices/scores associated with lymphoma\n* The International Prognostic Index (IPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 3**) \n* The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 4**) \n* The International Prognostic Score (IPS- for Hodgkin lymphomas) (**Site-Specific Factor 5**)\n\nPhysicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably. For coding\n\n* Score identified: Value in appropriate SSF, 999 in other two SSFs\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less: 999 in all three SSFs\n* Score not identified, point value 6 or 7: Value in SSF 5 (IPS), 999 in other two SSFs",
