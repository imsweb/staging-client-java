If specific information is available about some but not all of the high risk features, count the number of features documented in the record.\n\n* Poorly differentiated/Undifferentiated (grade 3 or 4)\n* Depth greater than 2 millimeters (mm)  thickness\n* Clark level IV or V\n* Perineural invasion\n\n**Note 3:**  Use codes 991, 992, and 993 only if no specific information is available about the high risk features, but the record contains a general statement about the presence of high risk features.",
