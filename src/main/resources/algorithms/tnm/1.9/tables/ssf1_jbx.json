(1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Tumor size expressed as 4.0 centimeter (cm) x 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm is recorded as follows:\n\n* Tumor Size: 040\n* Site-Specific Factor 1: 030 \n* Site-Specific Factor 2: 020 \n\nTumor size expressed as \"greater than 8 cm\" is recorded as follows: \n\n* Tumor Size: 997\n* Site-Specific Factor 1: 999\n* Site-Specific Factor 2: 999",
