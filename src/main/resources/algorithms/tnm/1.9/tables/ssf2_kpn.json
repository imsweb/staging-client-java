  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Most female primary peritoneal tumors have clinical course and treatment options similar to ovarian tumors.\n\n**Note 2:** It is very unlikely for this disease to have a FIGO Stage II or lower.\n\n**Note 3:**  Code the FIGO stage as stated in the medical record.  When lymph node(s) is/are clinically or pathologically positive or metastasis is present, make sure that the FIGO stage reflects the combination of T, N, and M and NOT just the T. \n* If a stage group is stated but it does not specify that it is a FIGO stage, assume that it is a FIGO stage and code it\n* Do not attempt to code FIGO stage based only on T, N, and M\n* If you cannot make a determination of stage based on the previous information, use code 999, stage unknown",
