The initial code is updated at the time of recurrence after the first course of globe-sparing treatment.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record 000 or 987 at initial diagnosis and treatment, depending on whether the initial treatment was globe-sparing or surgical enucleation.\n\n**Note 3:**  Change the recorded value of 000 to 010, 020, or 030 at the first recurrence in a treated eye after globe-sparing treatment.   \n* Use code 999 if recurrence is known but there is no more specific information available",
