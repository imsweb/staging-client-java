  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a tumor marker that has value in the management of certain malignancies.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record to the nearest tenth in Units/milliliter (U/ml), the highest CA 19-9 lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment. \n\n* For example, code a pretreatment CA 19-9 value of 60 U/ml as 600\n\n**Note 3:**  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 U/ml (no measurable amount of CA 19 9).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 U/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 U/ml should be coded 001.  \n\n* For code 001, also round 0.11 - 0.14 U/ml down to 0.1 U/ml\n* For codes 002-979, round values to the nearest tenth of a U/ml\n\n**Note 4:**  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  \n\n* For example, code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 U/ml\" as 005",
