  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  \"Multiple (satellite) nodules/tumors\" include satellitosis, multifocal tumors, and intrahepatic metastases.\n\n**Note 2:**  Major vascular invasion is defined as invasion of the branches of the main portal vein (right or left portal vein, not including sectoral or segmental branches) or as invasion of one or more of the three hepatic veins (right, middle, or left).  Invasion of the hepatic artery or vena cava is assigned T3.\n\n**Note 3:** Cholangiocarcinoma may be classified by growth pattern. The tumor growth patterns of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include the mass forming type, the periductal infiltrating type, and a mixed type.  The periductal infiltrating type of cholangiocarcinoma demonstrates a diffuse longitudinal growth pattern along the bile duct.  Limited analyses suggest that the diffuse periductal infiltrating type is associated with a poor prognosis. The presence of periductal invasion is assigned T4.",
