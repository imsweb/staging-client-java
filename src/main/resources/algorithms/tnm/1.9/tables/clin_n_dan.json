  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Note 2 specifies when to code certain tumor deposits (TD) here.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:** Per UICC, \"Tumor deposits (satellites), i.e., macroscopic or microscopic nests or nodules, in the pericolorectal adipose tissue's lymph drainage area of a primary carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule, may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread (V1/2) or a totally replaced lymph node (N1/2). If such deposits are observed with lesions that would otherwise be classified as T1 or T2, then the T classification is not changed, but the nodule(s) is recorded as N1c. If a nodule is documented by the pathologist to be a totally replaced lymph node (generally having a smooth contour), it should be recorded as a positive lymph node and not as a satellite, and each nodule should be counted separately as a lymph node in the final pN determination.\" (1)\n\n**Note 3:**  Assign N1 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n \n**All colon sites** \n\n    Colic [NOS] \n    Epicolic (adjacent to bowel wall) \n    Mesocolic [NOS] \n    Mesenteric [NOS]\n    Paracolic/pericolic\n\n    Lymph nodes, NOS\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n\n**Cecum (C180)** \n\n    Anterior (prececal) \n    Cecal [NOS]\n    Ileocolic\n    Periappendiceal\n    Posterior (retrocecal)\n    Right colic \n\n**Ascending colon (C182)** \n\n    Ileocolic\n    Middle colic\n    Right colic\n\n**Hepatic flexure (C183)** \n\n    Middle colic \n    Right colic\n\n**Transverse colon (C184)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Middle colic \n    Right colic\n\n**Splenic flexure (C185)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Middle colic\n\n**Descending colon (C186)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Sigmoid \n\n**Sigmoid colon (C187)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Rectosigmoid \n    Sigmoid \n    Sigmoidal (sigmoid mesenteric) \n    Superior haemorrhoidal (hemorrhoidal) \n    Superior rectal",
