The pharyngobasilar fascia is the fibrous layer of the pharyngeal wall between the mucosa and the muscular layer, attached superiorly to the basilar part of the occipital bone and diminishing in thickness as it descends.\n\n**Note 2:**  The masticator space primarily consists of the muscles of mastication, the medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis muscles.  The space also includes the ramus of the mandible and the third division of cranial nerve V as it passes through the foramen ovale into the suprahyoid neck.",
