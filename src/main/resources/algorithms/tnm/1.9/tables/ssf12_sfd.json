Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 ng/ml should be coded 001. \n* For values greater than 001 ng/ml, round values to the nearest ng/ml\n\n**Note 5:**  A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in ng/ml.\n\n**Note 6:**  If the initial post-orchiectomy AFP test remains elevated, review the subsequent tests until normalization or plateau occurs and use that test to code this field. \n\n**Note 7:**  If the post-orchiectomy AFP test is done but the actual value is not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 8:**  For rare cases that are treated prior to orchiectomy or an orchiectomy is not performed, code the initial AFP lab value in this field and not in **Site-Specific Factor 6, Pre-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Lab Value**.",
