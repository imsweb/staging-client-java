  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy specimen(s) will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes/stations. Three of these nodes/stations should be mediastinal, including the subcarinal nodes and 3 from N1 nodes/stations. Labeling according to the IASLC chart and table of definitions given in the TNM supplement is desirable. If all the lymph nodes examined are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:**  Vocal cord paralysis (resulting from involvement of the recurrent branch of the vagus nerve), superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor or to lymph node involvement.  The treatment options and prognosis associated with these manifestations of disease extent fall within the T4-Stage IIIB category; therefore, generally assign T4 for these manifestations and not regional lymph nodes. \n* If the primary tumor is peripheral and clearly unrelated to vocal cord paralysis, SVC obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, assign N2 for mediastinal lymph node involvement, unless there is a statement of involvement by direct extension from the primary tumor",
