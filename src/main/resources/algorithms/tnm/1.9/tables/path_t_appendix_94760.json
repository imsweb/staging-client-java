  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  High-grade dysplasia of the appendix is not always collected by cancer registries.\n* Assign pTis if your registry collects these tumors\n\n**Note 2:** pTis includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial) or lamina propria (intramucosal) with no extension through muscularis mucosa into submucosa. \n\n**Note 3:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:**  Mucinous tumors are identified by morphology codes 8480, 8481, and 8490.\n\n**Note 5:** One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules or tumor deposits (TD) in the periappendiceal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node.  Replaced nodes are counted as positive nodes and coded in Regional lymph nodes.  TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion are are assigned T3, and the number of TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion is coded in Site-Specific Factor 4.\n\n**Note 6:** Direct invasion in T4 includes invasion of other intestinal segments by way of the serosa, e.g., invasion of ileum. \n\n**Note 7:** Assign cT4b for tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures macroscopically. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be pT1, pT2 or pT3. \n\n**Note 8:**  Assign T4b for contiguous extension from the site of origin. \n* *Exception:* Intraperitoneal metastases limited to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen for mucinous tumors, discontinuous involvement is coded in M (distant metastasis)",
