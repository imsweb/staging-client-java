Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases. \n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is Stage III [NOS], IIIA, IIIB, or IV [NOS], IVA, or IVB, leave T blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:** Genital metastasis (vagina, ovary, broad ligament, fallopian tube) is classified T2. Any involvement of non-genital structures, whether by direct invasion or metastasis is described using the M (distant metastasis) classification.\n\n**Note 4:** For T, substaging is determined by the values in **Site-Specific Factor 1, Prognostic Scoring Index**.",
