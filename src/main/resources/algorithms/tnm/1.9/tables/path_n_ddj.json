  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:** UICC only has a N2, while AJCC has N2a, N2b, and N2c. If a record comes in with N2a, N2b, or N2c, reassign it to N2. N2 and the subcategories of N2 all stage the same way.\n\n**Note 4:** Size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node must be known to assign N. You may use a physician’s statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented pathologically\n* If the size of the lymph node(s) cannot be determined, assign N1\n* Do not code the size of any node(s) assigned in M (distant metastasis)\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n\n    Iliac, NOS\n         External\n         Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n             Obturator\n    Inguinal, NOS\n         Deep inguinal, NOS\n             Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n         Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n    Regional lymph node, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
