  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  This is a special molecular diagnostic test performed on tumor tissue to identify mutations in specific parts (called exons) of the KIT gene.  Certain patterns of mutations correlate with the anatomic site and morphology of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) tumors and can predict response to treatment with agents such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) and sunitinib malate (Sutent).  Some mutations are associated with acquired resistance to imatinib treatment; do not record secondary or acquired mutations that may have been caused by long-term imatinib treatment.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code the mutation locations found from the KIT gene test.  Another name for KIT is CD117.\n\n**Note 3:**  See **Site-Specific Factor 12, KIT Gene Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** for coding information about KIT expression detected with immunohistochemistry (IHC).Â  \n\n**Note 4:** See  **Site-Specific Factor 14, PDGFRA Gene Mutation** for coding information about mutations of the PDGFRA gene.",
