  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:**  Any finding of melanoma in lymph nodes, regardless of size and including isolated tumor cells (ITCs), are coded as positive lymph nodes.\n* Assign N1 If only ITCs are present\n\n**Note 3:**  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy. Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.\n* Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n\n **Note 4:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins. Secondary basins are regional for TNM staging.\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign N2c if there are satellite(s) or in-transit metastasis without regional lymph node involvement. Assign N3 if  both satellite nodules/in-transit metastases and regional lymph nodes are present. \n\n**Regional lymph nodes by skin primary site**\n* Head and Neck sites include bilateral or contralateral nodes\n\n**Lip (C440)**\n                                                        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS                                            \n       Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n       Nasolabial \n    Mandibular, NOS                             \n    Parotid, NOS                                           \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Submental                                         \n    Submandibular (submaxillary)             \n                \n**External ear/auditory canal (C442)**\n                                 \n    Cervical\n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)             \n    Preauricular                                             \n       \n**Face, Other (cheek, chin, forehead, jaw, nose and temple) (C443)**   \n        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS                                           \n        Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n        Nasolabial                                           \n    Mandibular, NOS                                         \n    Parotid, NOS                                       \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular     \n    Submental\n    Submandibular (submaxillary)                                    \n        \n**Scalp (C444)** \n                                                       \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS                                        \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical)\n                    \n**Neck (C444)**\n                                                      \n    Axillary                                                 \n    Mandibular, NOS                                          \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical) \n    Submental                   \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                    \n     \n**Trunk (C445)** \n                                                     \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Cervical                                                     \n    Internal mammary (parasternal)\n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                        \n    \n**Arm/Shoulder (C446)**\n                                                    \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Epitrochlear for hand/forearm                                \n    Spinal accessory for shoulder                                \n     \n**Leg/Hip (C447)**\n                                                         \n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Popliteal for heel and calf                                  \n     \n   **Bidirectional nodal involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n\n    Upper Trunk: Femoral (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)       \n    Lower Trunk: Axillary (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)\n                                                                      \n**Secondary nodal basin involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n         \n    Head and Neck: Supraclavicular                               \n    Arm/Shoulder: Supraclavicular               \n    Leg/Hip: Iliac                                                    \n    All sites: Regional lymph node(s) in secondary nodal basins, NOS",
