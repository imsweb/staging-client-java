Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning utilizes a radioactive form of glucose, called 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) that accumulates within malignant cells because of their high rate of metabolism.\n\n**Note 2:**  The value is expressed as a ratio of tissue radioactivity at the time of measurement to the injected dose at time of injection divided by body weight. Record the value for the SUV as reported in the medical record to one decimal place.",
