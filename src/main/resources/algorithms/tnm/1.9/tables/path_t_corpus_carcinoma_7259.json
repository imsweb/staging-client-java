  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO III [NOS], IIIC [NOS], IIIC1, or IIIC2, assign the appropriate stage and leave pathologic T, N, and M blank. If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO stage IVB, leave pathologic T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of carcinomas of the corpus uteri, but TNM does. Assign pTis and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 3:** To assign a T2 category, stromal connective tissue of the cervix must be involved; endocervical glandular involvement only is not classified as a T2 tumor in TNM. \n\n**Note 4:**  Extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.",
