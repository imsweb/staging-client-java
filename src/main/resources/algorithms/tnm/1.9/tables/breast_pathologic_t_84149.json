  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Microinvasion is the extension of cancer cells beyond the basement membrane into the adjacent tissues with no focus more than 0.1 cm in greatest dimension. When there are multiple foci of microinvasion, the size of only the largest focus is used to classify the microinvasion. (Do not use the sum of all individual foci). The presence of multiple foci of microinvasion should be noted, as it is with multiple larger invasive carcinomas. (1)\n\n**Note 2:** Paget disease with no underlying tumor is assigned to Tis but may be described as Paget disease, NOS (/3), invasive Paget disease (/3) or in situ Paget disease (/2) with no underlying tumor. \n\n**Note 3:** In assigning the T category, Paget disease associated with an underlying tumor is classified by the underlying tumor characteristics and size.\n\n    If Paget disease is associated with a DCIS or LCIS tumor \n    -it is classified as Tis (DCIS) or Tis (LCIS), respectively and \n    -the behavior code is /3 (if Paget disease, NOS or invasive Paget disease) or /2 (if in situ Paget disease)\n\n    If Paget disease is associated with an underlying invasive tumor confined to the breast\n    -it is classified based on the size of the tumor as T1-T3 (sub)categories and \n    -the behavior code is /3 (refer to SEER multiple primary rules for coding the histology code)]\n\n**Note 4:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3 or their subcategories. You may use a physician's statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2, or T3 (sub)categories, but no size or physician's statement of the T1-T3 (sub)category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 5:**  Dimpling of the skin, nipple retraction, or other skin changes, except those in T4b and T4d, may occur in T1, T2, or T3 (sub)categories without affecting the classification. Assign the appropriate T1-T3 (sub)category based on the tumor size.\n\n**Note 6:** Assign the appropriate T (sub)category (T1-T3) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Attachment or fixation to pectoral muscle(s) or underlying tissue\n    Confined to breast tissue and fat including nipple and/or areola\n    Deep fixation\n    Invasion of (or fixation to) pectoral fascia or muscle\n    Invasion of subcutaneous tissue\n    Local infiltration of dermal lymphatics adjacent to primary tumor involving skin by direct extension\n    Paget disease of nipple with underlying tumor \n    Skin infiltration of primary breast including skin of nipple and/or areola\n   \n    Confined to breast, NOS\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 7:**  Code adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening as clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue and assign T based on the tumor size (T1-T3 (sub)category).\n\n**Note 8:**  Code fixation, NOS as involvement of pectoralis muscle and assign T based on the tumor size (T1-T3 (sub)category).\n\n**Note 9:** Invasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4. Chest wall includes ribs, intercostal muscles, and serratus anterior muscle but not pectoral muscle. (1) \n\n**Note 10:** Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast is characterized by diffuse, brawny induration of the skin with an erysipeloid edge, usually with no underlying mass. If the skin biopsy is negative and there is no localized measurable primary cancer, the T category is pTX when pathologically staging a clinical inflammatory carcinoma (T4d). (1)\n\n**Note 11:**  A clinical description of inflammation, erythema, edema, peau d'orange, or other terms describing skin changes without a stated diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma should be assigned to T4b.",
