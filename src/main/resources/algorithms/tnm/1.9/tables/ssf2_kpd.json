  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Chromogranins are a family of proteins in secretory granules found throughout the neuroendocrine system.  Serum Chromogranin A (CgA) has been shown to be a useful marker for neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record, to the nearest nanogram/milliliter (ng/ml), the highest CgA lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment.  \n* For example, a pretreatment CgA of 400 ng/ml would be recorded as 400\n\n**Note 3:**  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0 ng/ml (no measurable amount of CgA).  Do not round tiny values down to 0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 1 ng/ml should be coded 001.  \n* For code 001, also round 1.1 - 1.4 ng/ml down to 1 ng/ml \n* For codes 002-980, round values to the nearest ng/ml\n\n**Note 4:**  Use code 997 if there is no actual pretreatment CgA lab value available but an interpretation of the test result is stated.\n\n**Note 5:**  Although CgA is generally a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, if a pretreatment CgA lab value is available for a non-endocrine tumor, code the value. \n* If a pretreament CgA lab value is not available (endocrine or non-endocrine tumor), code 999",
