  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The parenchyma of the kidney includes the following structures: cortex (outer layer of kidney), renal columns; medulla, medullary rays, renal pyramids, and renal papillae; nephrons (renal corpuscle, loops of Henle, proximal and distal tubules, collecting duct); glomerulus and surrounding Bowman's capsule.  The most common site for renal parenchymal cancer to develop is in the proximal convoluted tubule.  Tumor extension from one of these structures into another is coded to Localized (code 100) in the absence of further involvement.\n\n**Note 2:**  Gerota's fascia is a fibrous tissue sheath surrounding the kidney and suprarenal or adrenal gland.  The perirenal fat, renal capsule, and renal parenchyma lie below the fascia.\n\n**Note 3:** Direct extension to or other involvement of the following structures are coded in SEER Mets: contralateral kidney; contralateral ureter; liver from left kidney; spleen from right kidney.",
