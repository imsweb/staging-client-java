  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The bones of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity include the maxilla, the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate, the labyrinth and inferior concha of the ethmoid. The roof of the nasal cavity is formed by the nasal bone. The floor of the nasal cavity, which forms the roof of the mouth, is composed of the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly.\n\n**Note 2:**  \"Bony invasion\" does not include extension to palate, cribriform plate, or pterygoid plates.  Extension to these structures is coded separately.",
