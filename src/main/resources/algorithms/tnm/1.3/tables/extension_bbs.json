  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Over 90% of penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas arising in the skin.  Other cancers arising in the skin include adenocarcinomas (5%) arising in sweat glands, melanomas (2%, included in the Melanoma schema), and basal cell carcinoma (2%).  About 1% of penile cancers are sarcomas, arising in subcutaneous connective tissues.\n\n**Note 2:**  Verrucous carcinoma (M-8051) is a locally aggressive, exophytic, low grade carcinoma with minimal metastatic potential. \n\n**Note 3:** If verrucous carcinoma is described as noninvasive or as having a broad pushing border or penetration, assign code **050**. If verrucous carcinoma is not so characterized, assign code **070**, Verrucous carcinoma, NOS. If there is destructive invasion of verrucous carcinoma into structures in code **100** or greater, assign the appropriate higher code. \n\n**Note 4:**  Information about involvement of the corpus spongiosum or corpus cavernosum is collected in this field for anatomic staging.  This information is also collected in Site-Specific Factor 10 because involvement of these structures may have an independent effect on prognosis.",
