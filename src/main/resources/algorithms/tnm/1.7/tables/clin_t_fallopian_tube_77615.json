If the only information is FIGO stage IV, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of the fallopian tube, but TNM does. Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 3:**  Liver capsule metastasis is T3/Stage III, liver parenchymal metastasis, M1/Stage IV. \n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are assigned as FIGO Stage II and coded in T2a or T2b.\n * Adnexa, NOS; bladder, bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; contralateral fallopian tube; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; ureter; uterus; uterine serosa\n\n**Note 5:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs are classified as FIGO Stage III and coded in T3. \n* Abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; ureters",
