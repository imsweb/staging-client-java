  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Pathologic stage follows clinical stage with clinical information supplemented by the information obtained from staging laparotomy and splenectomy. Since the current approach to treatment almost always includes systemic treatment, staging laparotomy is no longer performed and pathologic staging is usually not available. (1)\n* Staging laparotomies include: laparotomy/laparoscopy, splenectomy, liver, lymph node & bone marrow biopsies. All of these must be done to qualify as a staging laparotomy\n* If a staging laparotomy is not performed, pathologic stage group is coded as 99\n\n**Note 2:** The lymphatic structures are as follows\n* Lymph nodes (C770-C779)\n* Waldeyer's ring (tonsils) (C024, C090-C099, C111, C142)\n* Spleen (C422)\n* Thymus (C379)\n    \n**Note 3:** Spleen involvement only (C422) is a lymphatic site (structure); however, it is noted differently. \n* If only the spleen is involved, assign 2: S (Spleen, lymphomas, only) in the **Pathologic Stage (Prefix/Suffix) Descriptor**\n\n**Note 4:** Spleen involvement with a lymphatic or extralymphatic primary site is accepted if there is palpable enlargement of the spleen confirmed by imaging. (1)\n\n**Note 5:** Extralymphatic sites include all other sites (e.g., stomach, colon, breast, nasopharynx). \n* If an extralymphatic site is involved, assign 1: E (Extranodal, lymphomas, only) in the **Pathologic Stage (Prefix/Suffix) Descriptor**\n\n**Note 6:** If there is an extralymphatic site that also has Spleen involvement,  assign 5: E (Extranodal and spleen, lymphomas, only) in the **Pathologic Stage (Prefix/Suffix) Descriptor**. \n\n**Note 7:** Lung involvement limited to one lobe, or perihilar extension associated with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, or unilateral pleural effusion with or without lung involvement but with hilar lymphadenopathy is classified as localized extralymphatic disease. (1)\n\n**Note 8:** Any mention of the terms including fixed, matted, mass in the hilum, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and/or mesentery, palpable, enlarged, shotty, lymphadenopathy are all regarded as involvement for lymphomas when assigning stage.\n\n**Note 9:** Clinical evidence of liver involvement must include either enlargement of the liver and at least an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase level and two different liver function test abnormalities, or an abnormal liver demonstrated by imaging and one abnormal liver function test. (1)\n\n**Note 10:** Each stage should be divided into A and B according to the absence or presence of defined general symptoms. These are\n* Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of the usual body weight in the 6 months prior to first attendance\n* Unexplained fever with temperature above 38 degree C\n * Night sweats\n\n**Note 11:**: Pruritus alone does not qualify for B classification nor does a short, febrile illness associated with a known infection.\n\n**Note 12:** See **Site-Specific Factor #2, Systemic Symptoms at Diagnosis** to code the presence or absence of B symptoms.",
