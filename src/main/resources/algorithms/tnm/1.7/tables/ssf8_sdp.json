  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Some gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have oncogenic mutations of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene, located on chromosome 4q.  This test is a special molecular diagnostic test performed on tumor tissue to identify PDGFRA mutations.  Some GISTs that are negative for KIT mutations are positive for PDGFRA mutation.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code the result of the PDGFRA gene test.  Another name for PDGFRA is CD140A.\n\n**Note 3:**  See **Site-Specific Factor 6, KIT Gene Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** and **Site Specific Factor 7, KIT Gene Mutations** for coding information about KIT gene expression and mutations.",
