You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 5:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Extension to any of the following WITHOUT bone invasion\n       Globe (eyeball)\n       Optic nerve\n       Orbital soft tissues\n\n    Confined to lacrimal gland\n    Localized, NOS",
