If the only information is FIGO stage IV, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** Histological examination of a pelvic lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO classifies such cases as pNX).
