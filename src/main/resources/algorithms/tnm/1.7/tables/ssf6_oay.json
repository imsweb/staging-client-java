  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Record the value of the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) test as documented in the patient record prior to orchiectomy and other treatment.\n\n**Note 2:**Â Use the same laboratory test to record values in **Site-Specific Factor 6, Pre-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Lab Value** and **Site-Specific Factor 7, Pre-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Range**.\n\n**Note 3:** Record a pretreatment AFP of 20 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) as 002; record a pretreatment AFP of 11,000 ng/ml as 200.\n\n**Note 4:** Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 ng/ml (no measurable amount of AFP). Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 ng/ml should be coded 001. \n* For values greater than 001 ng/ml, round values to the nearest ng/ml\n\n**Note 5:**  A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/l) is equivalent to the same value expressed in ng/ml.\n\n**Note 6:**  If the pre-orchiectomy AFP test is done but the actual value is not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 7:**  For rare cases that are treated prior to orchiectomy, use code 995 in this field and record the initial AFP lab value in **Site-Specific Factor 12, Post-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Lab Value**.\n\n**Note 8:**  For rare cases that an orchiectomy is not performed, use code 996 in this field and record the initial AFP lab value in **Site-Specific Factor 12, Post-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Lab Value**.",
