Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) stated to be in situ, noninvasive, or confined to mucosa are classified as Tis.  \n* \"Dysplasia\" alone is generally not reportable in cancer registries but, if a registry does collect it, assign Tis\n\n**Note 2:**  Intraluminal or intramural extension to esophagus and duodenum is classified by the depth of greatest invasion. \n* For extension to esophagus or duodenum via serosa, assign T4\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasion into\n        Lamina propria, including lamina propria in a polyp \n        Muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in a polyp\n        Submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in a polyp\n\n    Implants inside stomach\n\n    Confined to stomach\n    Localized, NOS",
