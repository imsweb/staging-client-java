If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO stage IVB, leave pathologic T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1a or T1b. You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 category, but no size or category is specified, assign T1",
