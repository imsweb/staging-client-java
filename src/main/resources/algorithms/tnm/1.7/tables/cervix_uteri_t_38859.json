Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO IIIB, assign the appropriate stage and leave pathologic T, N, and M blank. If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO stage IVB, leave pathologic T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:**  All macroscopically visible lesions, even with superficial invasion, are assigned to T1b/FIGO Stage IB.\n\n**Note 4:**  Involvement of the anterior and/or posterior septum, the tissue between the vagina and bladder and between the vagina and rectum, is coded as involvement of the vaginal wall.\n\n**Note 5:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T1 subgroups based on the depth of invasion and horizontal spread of the tumor. \n\n    Invasive carcinoma confined to cervix, clinically visible lesion\n\n    Localized, NOS\n    Confined to cervix uteri or uterus, NOS, except corpus uteri, NOS\n    (Not clinically visible or unknown if clinically visible)\n\n    Extension to\n       Cul de sac (rectouterine pouch)\n       Upper two-thirds of vagina including fornices\n       Vagina, NOS\n       Vaginal wall, NOS\n    WITHOUT parametrial invasion\n\n    Extension beyond uterus, NOS but not to pelvic wall (excluding lower third of vagina)\n    WITHOUT parametrial invasion",
