  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The fimbria is the fringe of tissue around the ostium of the fallopian tube, in the direction of the ovary.  The infundibulum is a funnel-shaped expansion of the tube which opens in the fimbria.  Medial to the infundibulum is the ampulla, which forms over half the length of the tube.  Medial to the ampulla is the isthmus, which forms one-third of the tube.  The interstitial segment continues from the isthmus through the uterine wall to empty into the uterine cavity.\n\n**Note 2:**  Use code 999 if primary site is described as fallopian tube but no information is available about the segment in which the tumor arose.",
