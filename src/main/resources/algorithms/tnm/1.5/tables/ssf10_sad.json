  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Record the results of only the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in this field.  The test determines if there are additional copies of the HER2/neu gene in the tumor cells compared to the normal number.  The results are reported as a ratio between the number of copies of the HER2/neu gene and the number of copies of chromosome 17, on which the gene resides.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the actual ratio if given.  Enter the stated ratio to two decimal places.  Use a trailing zero if needed.\n\n**Note 3:**  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in **Site-Specific Factor 10, HER2: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Lab Value** and **Site-Specific Factor 11, HER2: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Test Interpretation**.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the test is done but the actual ratio is not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the test is not mentioned in the medical record, code to 999 unless there are circumstances under which the test isn't performed, for example, no histologic specimen.",
