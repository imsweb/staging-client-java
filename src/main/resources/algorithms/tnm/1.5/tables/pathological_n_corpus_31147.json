  "notes" : "**Note 1:** When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO III [NOS] or IIIC, assign the appropriate stage and leave pathologic T, N, and M blank. If the only information is FIGO stage IVB, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** Histological examination of a pelvic lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO classifies such cases as pNX).

Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 4:**  Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral involvement of named nodes.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n\n    Aortic, NOS\n        Lateral (lumbar)\n        Para-aortic\n        Periaortic\n    Iliac, NOS\n        Common\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric)\n            Obturator\n    Paracervical\n    Parametrial\n    Pelvic, NOS\n    Sacral, NOS\n        Lateral (laterosacral)\n        Middle (promontorial) (Gerota's node)\n        Presacral\n        Uterosacral\n\n    Pelvic lymph nodes, NOS\n\n    FIGO Stage IIIC (pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes)\n    FIGO Stage IIIC1 (pelvic lymph nodes)\n    FIGO Stage IIIC2 (para-aortic lymph nodes WITH or WITHOUT pelvic lymph nodes)",
