  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 2:**  Mucinous tumors are identified by morphology codes 8480, 8481, and 8490.\n\n**Note 3:** One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules or tumor deposits (TD) in the periappendiceal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node. Replaced nodes are counted as positive nodes and coded in SEER Regional Lymph Nodes. TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion are coded in SEER Primary Tumor, Regional by direct extension only, code 200.\n\n**Note 4:**  High-grade dysplasia is not always collected by cancer registries but, if collected, it should be coded In situ 000.\n\n**Note 5:**  Terminology such as “Transmural, NOS” and “Extension through the wall, NOS” typically means that the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria but has not necessarily invaded the entire thickness of the colon wall.",
