When both FIGO stage and regional lymph node detail are available, record the code with regional lymph node detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 4:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume nodes are negative.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.",
