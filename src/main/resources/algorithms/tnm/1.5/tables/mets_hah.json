  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Peritoneal implants outside the pelvis must be microscopically confirmed. Peritoneal implants may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding.\n\n**Note 2:** If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen code appropriately to regional by direct extension or to distant. If not stated, code to distant \n\n**Note 3:** FIGO stages are included for coding where no more specific information is available in the record.  FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on distant site(s) and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code SEER Mets based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of distant involvement. If FIGO Stage IIIC is specified but it is unknown whether it is based on distant site(s) or regional lymph node involvement, code to SEER Regional Nodes.",
