Distant nodes are coded in the field SEER Mets. \n\n**Note 2:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral named nodes. \n\n**Note 3:** FIGO stages are included for coding where no more specific information is available in the record. FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code SEER Regional Nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of regional lymph node involvement or it is not specified.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but doesn't mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved, code \"000\". \n\n**Note 5:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume regional nodes are not involved.",
