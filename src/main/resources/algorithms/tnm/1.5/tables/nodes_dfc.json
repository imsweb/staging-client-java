Mesenteric nodes, NOS are coded in SEER Regional Nodes.\n\n**Note 3:**  One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules or tumor deposits (TD) in the periappendiceal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node. Replaced nodes are counted as positive nodes and coded in SEER Regional Nodes.  TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion are coded in SEER Primary Tumor, Regional by direct extension only.",
