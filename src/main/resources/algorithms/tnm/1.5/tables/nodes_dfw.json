Distant nodes are coded in  SEER Mets.\n\n**Note 2:**  Bilateral nodes are considered regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins may be considered distant for Summary Stage.  \n\n**Note 4:**  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded in SEER Regional Nodes.",
