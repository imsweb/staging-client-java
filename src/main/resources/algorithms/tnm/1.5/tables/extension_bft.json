The second-order biliary radicals are the next largest branches or ducts of the biliary system which join to form or empty into the main hepatic bile duct. \n\n**Note 3:**  Involvement within the  porta hepatis is coded according to the structures involved: portal vein, common hepatic artery, and common hepatic duct.",
