TNM does not include an in situ category for mucosal melanoma tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Mucosal melanomas are aggressive tumors, therefore, T1 and T2 are omitted, as are Stages I and II.\n\n**Note 3:**  The intrinsic muscles of tongue are four paired muscles within the tongue which control its shape.  The extrinsic muscles originate from structures outside the tongue and control its positioning.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T3 for localized tumor when no other information is available or for extension involving the mucosa only of adjacent sites.\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4a or T4b for extension involving the deeper tissues of the primary or adjacent sites.",
