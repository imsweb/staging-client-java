  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  When both Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code regional (code 200) based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension. \n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO no longer includes a Stage 0 (Tis) for this schema.\n\n**Note 3:**  Liver capsule metastases are coded in SEER Primary Tumor; liver parenchymal metastases are coded in SEER Mets.\n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are considered FIGO Stage II and coded in primary tumor as regional (code 200): adnexa, NOS; bladder, bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; contralateral fallopian tube; omentum; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; small intestine; ureter; uterus; uterine serosa. \n\n**Note 5:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs are considered FIGO Stage III and coded in SEER Mets: abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS;  spleen; stomach; ureters.\n\n**Note 6:**  Code unknown (code 999) if inadequate staging biopsies and/or a lack of peritoneal cytology make it inaccurate to classify the patient with confidence as early stage (Stage T3a/IIIA has not been excluded by adequate staging biopsies).",
