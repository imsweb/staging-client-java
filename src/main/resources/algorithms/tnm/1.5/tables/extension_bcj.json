  "notes" : "**Note 1:** In the United States and Canada, Kaposi sarcoma is usually an illness related to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which affects primarily the skin; however, lesions may also form in the connective tissue, mucosa (e.g. oral cavity) or visceral organs (e.g. lungs).  For connective tissue tumors (C49._), use extension codes for skin.\n\n**Note 2:**  Choice of Summary Stage for Kaposi sarcoma depends on number and location of lesions.  For example, use code 100 (Localized)  for a single or multiple lesions involving skin.  Use code 200 (Regional) for any number of lesions involving both skin and viscera.",
