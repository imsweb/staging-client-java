  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  *The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)* is a numerical scale used to determine how urgently a patient with liver disease needs a liver transplant within the next three months.  Results from three routine lab tests are used to calculate the MELD score.  International normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR), one of the tests, measures the liver's ability to make blood clotting factors.\n\n**Note 2:**  The normal range for a healthy person is 0.9-1.3.  A high INR level such as INR=5 indicates that there is a high chance of bleeding.  A low level such as INR = 0.5 indicates a high chance of abnormal clotting.  Normal values may vary from lab to lab.  Record the highest INR value prior to treatment.\n\n**Note 3:**  Record INR of 0.5 as 005; record INR of 5 as 050.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the test was done but the actual value is not stated, code 997.",
