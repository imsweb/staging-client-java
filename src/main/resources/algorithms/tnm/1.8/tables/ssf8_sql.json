For unresectable cases, the information can be determined from radiological imaging studies or physician documentation).\n\n**Note 2:**  Use code 001 when tumor is described as unifocal; arising from or occurring in a single focus or location.\n\n**Note 3:**  The TNM definition for multifocal tumor differs from the MP/H definition for Multiplicity Counter.  Use code 002 for any tumor with multiple foci, even if foci are not measured.",
