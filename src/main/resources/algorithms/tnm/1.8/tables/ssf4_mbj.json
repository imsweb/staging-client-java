  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The Follicular Lymphoma Prognostic Index (FLIPI) has been developed for follicular lymphomas and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors\n* Age more than 60 years       \n* Ann Arbor Stage III or IV\n* More than 4 nodal areas involved\n* Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase LDH level\n* Serum hemoglobin concentration less than 12 grams/deciliter (g/dl)\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the FLIPI as documented in the medical record.   Do not  calculate points or assign risk. Only record points or risk if a physician has documented them. Use points over risk if both are available.\n\n**Note 3:**  There are now two indices/scores associated with lymphoma \n* The International Prognostic Index (IPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 3**) \n* The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 4**) \n\nPhysicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably.  For coding\n* Score identified:  Value in appropriate SSF, 999 in other SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less:  999 in both SSF",
