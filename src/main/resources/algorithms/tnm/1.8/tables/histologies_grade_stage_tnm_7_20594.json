While the NAACCR field definition includes the leading zeros, this avoids problems with different methods of storing the information.\n\n**Note 2:** It is possible to have a clinical T other than T4-T4b for Anaplastic cases if the histology or grade was adjusted after pathology results are obtained.  In these cases, which should be rare, the Clinical Stage Group will follow the Papillary and Follicular rules.",
