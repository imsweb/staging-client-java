If the only information is FIGO stage IV, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** Primary peritoneal carcinomas may not involve the ovaries or only involve the ovaries \"with minimal surface implants. The clinical presentation, surgical therapy, chemotherapy, and prognosis of these peritoneal tumors mirror those of papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary. Patients who undergo prophylactic oophorectomy for a familial history of ovarian cancer appear to retain a 1 to 2% chance of developing peritoneal adenocarcinoma, which is histopathologically and clinically similar to primary ovarian cancer.",
