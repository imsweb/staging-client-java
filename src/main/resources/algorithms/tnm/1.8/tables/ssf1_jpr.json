CA-125 is a tumor marker or biomarker that may be elevated in the blood of some patients with primary peritoneal carcinoma.\n\n**Note 2:** Record only the blood or serum CA-125 value for this data item. Do not record CA-125 test results based on fluid from the chest or abdominal cavity.\n\n**Note 3:** Record the CA-125 status prior to treatment.\n\n**Note 4:** Normal values may vary with patient age and from lab to lab. The typical human reference ranges are 0 to 35 micrograms per milliliter (ug/ml).",
