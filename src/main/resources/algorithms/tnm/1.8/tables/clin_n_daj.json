  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes such as cervical (excluding supraclavicular) or contralateral axillary and/or contralateral internal mammary are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:** Clinically detected is defined as detected by clinical examination or by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) and having characteristics highly suspicious for malignancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytological examination. (1)\n\n**Note 3:** Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is classified as a clinical N, e.g., cN1. Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or sentinel lymph node biopsy only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment. (1)\n\n**Note 4:**  In a physical exam if palpable nodes are not described as fixed or matted, assume that nodes are movable.\n\n**Note 5:** The breast lymphatics drain by way of three major routes: axillary, transpectoral, and internal mammary. Intramammary lymph nodes reside within breast tissue and are coded as axillary lymph nodes for staging purposes. Supraclavicular lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph nodes for staging purposes. \n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n\n**Axillary (ipsilateral):** Interpectoral (Rotter) nodes and lymph nodes along the axillary vein and its tributaries, which may be divided into the following levels: \n\n    Level I (low-axilla)\n       Lymph nodes lateral to the lateral border of pectoralis minor muscle\n    Level II (mid-axilla): lymph nodes between: \n       Medial lateral borders of the pectoralis minor muscle and interpectoral (Rotter's) lymph nodes\n    Level III (apical axilla)\n       Lymph nodes medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle and inferior to the clavicle\n       Infraclavicular (subclavicular) nodes\n    The infraclavicular designation may be used for level III nodes to differentiate these nodes from the remaining level I and II axillary nodes\n   \n**Internal mammary (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the intercostal spaces along the end of the sternum in the endothoracic fascia\n\n**Supraclavicular (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa: A triangle defined by the omohyoid muscle and tendon (lateral and superior border) \n    \n**Intramammary** \n\n     Lymph nodes within the breast: Intramammary lymph nodes are coded as axillary lymph nodes level I",
