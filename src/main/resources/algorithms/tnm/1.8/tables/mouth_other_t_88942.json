  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones. Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of the bone. Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:**  Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 3:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone.\n\n    Invasive tumor on one side confined to\n        Lamina propria\n        Submucosa\n    \n    Adjacent oral cavity\n    Bone, NOS\n    Cortical bone of mandible\n    Cortical bone of maxilla\n    Cortical bone, NOS\n    Inferior surface of soft palate\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Lingual surface of epiglottis\n    Mandible, NOS\n    Maxilla, NOS\n    Musculature invaded\n    Oropharynx\n    Vallecula\n\n    Confined to mouth, NOS\n    Localized,  NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a.",
