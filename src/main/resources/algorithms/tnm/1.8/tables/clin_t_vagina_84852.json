Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases. \n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is FIGO III assign the appropriate stage and leave clinical T, N, and M blank. If the only information is FIGO stage IVB, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:** The presence of bullous edema is not sufficient evidence to classify a tumor as T4.\n\n**Note 4:**  The pelvic wall is defined as muscle, fascia, neurovascular structures, or skeletal portions of the bony pelvis.",
