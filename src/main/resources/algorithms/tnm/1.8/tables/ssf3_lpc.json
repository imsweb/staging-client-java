  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  CEA is a tumor marker that has value in the management of certain malignancies.\n\n**Note 2:**  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in **Site-Specific Factor 2, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)** and **Site Specific Factor 3, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Lab Value**.\n\n**Note 3:**  Record to the nearest tenth in nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) the highest CEA lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment. \n\n* For example, code a pretreatment CEA of 7 ng/ml as 070\n\n**Note 4:**  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 ng/ml (no measurable amount of CEA).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 ng/ml should be coded 001.  \n\n* For code 001, also round 0.11-0.14 ng/ml down to 0.1 ng/ml \n* For codes 002-979, round values to the nearest tenth of a ng/ml\n\n**Note 5:**  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  \n\n* For example, code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 ng/ml\" as 005",
