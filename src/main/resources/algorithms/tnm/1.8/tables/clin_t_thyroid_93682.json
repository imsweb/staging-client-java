  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for thyroid tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Per TNM, anaplastic carcinomas are assigned T4. If a clinical workup confirms a non-anaplastic histology that is followed by a pathologic confirmation of anaplastic (pT4), a clinical T other than cT4 may be assigned. If the only information is clinical, then a cT4 must be assigned if the histology is anaplastic.\n* Anaplastic is defined by: histology (8020/3, 8021/3, 8030/3, 8031/3, 8032/3) or Grade 4 (undifferentiated, anaplastic)\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Single invasive tumor confined to thyroid\n    Extension into thyroid capsule, but not beyond\n    Multiple foci confined to thyroid\n\n    Confined to thyroid, NOS   \n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 5:** Multifocal tumors of all histological types should be designated (m) (the largest determines the classification), e.g, T2. \n* Record the information regarding solitary vs. multifocal tumors in **Site-Specific Factor 1, Solitary vs Multifocal Tumor**",
