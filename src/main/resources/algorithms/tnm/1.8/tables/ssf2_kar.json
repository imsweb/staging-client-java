Do not code invasion of small unnamed vein(s) of the type collected as lymph-vascular invasion. Lymph-vascular invasion is usually only seen microscopically. \n* Assign code 000 if surgical resection of the primary site is performed, the pathology report is available for review, and involvement of these specified veins is not mentioned",
