  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The International Prognostic Score (IPS) has been developed for Hodgkin lymphoma and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors \n\n* Male sex\n* Age 45 years or greater\n* Ann Arbor Stage IV \n* Serum albumin less than 4 grams/deciliter (g/dl)\n* Hemoglobin concentration less than 10.5 g/dl\n* White blood cell count greater than or equal to 15,000/cubic millimeter (mm)\n* Lymphocytopenia, lymphocyte count less than 600/cubic mm or less than 8% of white cell count\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the IPS score as documented in the medical record.  Do not calculate points. Only record points if a physician has documented them.\n\n**Note 3:**  There are now three indices/scores associated with lymphoma\n* The International Prognostic Index (IPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 3**) \n* The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (**Site-Specific Factor 4**) \n* The International Prognostic Score (IPS- for Hodgkin lymphomas) (**Site-Specific Factor 5**)\n\nPhysicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably. For coding\n\n* Score identified: Value in appropriate SSF, 999 in other two SSFs\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less: 999 in all three SSFs\n* Score not identified, point value 6 or 7: Value in SSF 5 (IPS), 999 in other two SSFs",
