  "notes" : "**Note 1:**   FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of the vulva, but TNM does. Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases. \n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO III [NOS], IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, or IVA, assign the appropriate stage and leave pathologic T, N, and M blank. If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO stage IVB, leave pathologic T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:**  FIGO Stage I, IA and IB are defined by the following\n* Size of tumor \n* Involvement of vulva OR vulva and perineum\n* Depth of stromal invasion\n\n**Note 4:**  The depth of invasion is defined as the measurement of the tumor from the epithelial-stromal junction of the adjacent most superficial dermal papilla to the deepest point of invasion. (1)\n\n**Note 5:** T3 is not used by FIGO. They label it T4. If you have a record which states T4, assign T3. (1)\n\n**Note 6:** FIGO Stage IVA is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.",
