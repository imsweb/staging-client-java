  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2, JAK 2)is a gene mutation that increases susceptibility to several myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Testing for the JAK2 mutation is done on whole blood. Nearly all people with polycythemia vera and about half of those with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis have the mutation.\n\n**Note 2:**  JAK2 is used primarily for the following histologies: Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocytopenia, and Primary Myelofibrosis. Its usage continues to increase and may be used for other histologies in the future. Record JAK2 for any hematopoietic/reticuloendothelial disease even if it is not one of these three specific histologies.\n\n**Note 3:**  If JAK2 test result is positive, NOS, use code 850.",
