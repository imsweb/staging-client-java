This is distinguished from artifactual invasion, or groups of tumor cells in the open spaces beween intraocular structures, extraocular tissues, and/or subarachnoid space.  \n\n**Note 2:** Focal choroidal invasion is a solid nest of tumor measuring less than 3 millimeter (mm) in maximum diameter.  Massive choroidal invasion is a solid tumor nest 3 mm or more in maximum diameter.",
