Milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl) is the unit of measure commonly used in the United States, and micromoles/liter (umol/l) is the designated Systeme Internationale (SI) unit of measure commonly used in Canada and Europe. 1 mg/dl of creatinine is 88.4 umol/l.\n\n**Note 2:**  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in **Site-Specific Factor 4, Creatinine Value** and **Site Specific Factor 5, Creatinine Unit of Measure**.",
