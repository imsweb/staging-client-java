The response may be called \"treatment effect\" and will often be stated in terms of a Tumor Regression Grade  of 0 to 3.  The response may also be characterized in descriptive terms.  Consult the pathologist if a different grading system is used.\n\n**Note 2:**  Tumor regression grade or treatment effect should only be assessed on the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 3:**  If a response is stated to be present or found but is not described further, use code 990.",
