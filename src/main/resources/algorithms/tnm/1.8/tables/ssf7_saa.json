Terms seen on pathology reports may include\n* Bloom-Richardson (BR) \n* Modified Bloom-Richardson, BR \n* BR grading \n* Scarff-Bloom-Richardson \n* SBR grading \n* Elston-Ellis modification of Bloom-Richardson score \n* Nottingham modification of Bloom-Richardson score\n* Nottingham modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson\n* Nottingham-Tenovus grade\n* Nottingham grade\n\n**Note 2:**  Code the highest score prior to neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n**Note 3:**  Code the tumor grade using the following priority order\n* BR scores 3-9 \n* BR grade (low, intermediate, high).\n\n**Note 4:**  BR score may be expressed as a range, 3-9.  The score is based on three morphologic features of \"invasive no-special-type\" breast cancers \n* Degree of tubule formation/histologic grade\n* Mitotic activity \n* Nuclear pleomorphism/nuclear grade of tumor cells).  \n\nIf a report describes any of the factors with words (low, intermediate, high) rather than numbers, do not attempt to translate these words into a score or number; use codes 110-130.\n\n**Note 5:**  If only a grade of 1 through 4 is given with no information on the score and it is unclear if it is a Nottingham or BR Grade, code 999.\n\n**Note 6:** Code the highest score prior to neoadjuvant treatment if multiple scores are reported.  \n* For examples, different scores may be reported on multiple pathology reports for the same primary cancer; different scores may be reported for multiple tumors assigned to the same primary cancer",
