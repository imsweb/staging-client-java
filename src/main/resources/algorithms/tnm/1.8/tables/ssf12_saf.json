  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Record the results of only the Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization (CISH) test for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in this field.  The test determines whether there are additional copies of the HER2/neu gene in the tumor cells. The results are reported as the mean number of copies of the HER2/neu gene on either 30 or 60 tumor cells.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the actual mean if given.  Enter the stated mean to two decimal places.  Use a trailing zero if needed.\n\n**Note 3:**  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in **Site-Specific Factor 12, HER2: Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization (CISH) Lab Value** and **Site-Specific Factor 13, HER2: Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization (CISH) Test Interpretation**.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the test is done but the actual mean is not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the test is not mentioned in the medical record, code to 999 unless there are circumstances under which the test isn't performed, for example, no histologic specimen.",
