  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for kidney parenchyma tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Gerota fascia is a fibrous tissue sheath surrounding the kidney and suprarenal or adrenal gland.  The perirenal fat, renal capsule, and renal parenchyma lie below the fascia.\n\n**Note 3:**  The parenchyma of the kidney includes the following structures\n* Cortex (outer layer of kidney), renal columns; medulla, medullary rays, renal pyramids, and renal papillae; nephrons (renal corpuscle, loops of Henle, proximal and distal tubules, collecting duct); glomerulus and surrounding Bowman's capsule  \n\n**Note 4:** The most common site for renal parenchymal cancer to develop is in the proximal convoluted tubule. \n* Tumor extension from one of these structures into another is assigned T1a - T2b depending on size in the absence of further involvement\n\n**Note 5:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 6:**  Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasive cancer confined to kidney cortex and/or medulla\n\n    Invasion of renal capsule\n    Renal pelvis or calyces involved\n    Separate focus of tumor in renal pelvis/calyx\n\n    Confined to kidney\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 7:**  Information about invasion beyond the capsule, venous involvement, and ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement is collected in this field for anatomic staging.  \n* This information is also collected in **Site-Specific Factor 1, Site-Specific Factor 2, and Site-Specific Factor 3**, as these factors may have an independent effect on prognosis\n\n**Note 8:**  Direct extension to OR involvement of other structures is coded in M (distant metastasis). This includes: \n* Contralateral kidney; contralateral ureter; liver from left kidney; spleen from right kidney",
