  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Superficial erosion alone of bone/tooth socket by gingival primary is not sufficient to code as bone involvement. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones. Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of the bone. Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1-T3) based on the tumor size when the tumor involvement is limited to the cortical bone for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to lamina propria (mucoperiosteum) (stroma)\n\n    Bone, NOS\n    Buccal mucosa (inner cheek)\n    Cartilage of mandible or maxilla\n    Cartilage, NOS\n    Cortical bone of mandible or maxilla\n    Cortical bone, NOS\n    Fascial muscle, NOS\n    Floor of mouth\n    Labial mucosa (inner lip), lower lip\n    Labial mucosa (inner lip), lip, NOS\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Mandible, NOS\n    Maxilla, NOS\n    Soft palate including uvula\n    Subcutaneous soft tissue of face\n    Tongue mucosa\n    Tonsillar pillars and fossae\n    Tonsils\n\n    Confined to gum, NOS\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 5:**  Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a.",
