TNM nor FIGO include an in situ category for ovary tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the T in preference to a statement of FIGO stage - see Registrar notes.\n* If the only information is FIGO stage III [NOS] or IIIC, assign the appropriate stage and leave clinical T, N, and M blank. If the only information is FIGO stage IV, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 3:**  T1 and T2 tumors with malignant ascites are classified as T1c and T2c (FIGO Stages IC and IIC), respectively.  \n* Ascites, NOS is negative \n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are included in the T2 category (FIGO Stage II): \n* Adnexa, NOS; bladder and bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; fallopian tubes; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectosigmoid; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; pelvic ureter; uterus and uterine serosa\n\n**Note 5:**  Peritoneal implants outside the pelvis must be microscopically confirmed.  \n* Peritoneal implants may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding\n\n**Note 6:**  If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen and code appropriately.  \n* If the location of the implants are not specified, assign T3\n\n**Note 7:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs by way of peritoneal seeding or implants are included in the T3 category (FIGO Stage III)\n* Abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; and ureters outside pelvis\n* Residual tumor in any of these organs are classified as FIGO III and coded in T3 and in **Site-Specific Factors 3 and 4**. (Hematogenous metastases are included in M1 (FIGO Stage IV) disease\n\n**Note 8:**  Parenchymal liver nodules are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 9:**  In some registries benign/borderline ovarian tumors are reportable by agreement.  \n* If the tumor being reported is benign or borderline, code primary tumor to TX",
