  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The mitotic count, the number of mitoses per 40 high-power fields (HPF), reflects the potential aggressiveness or prognosis of uveal melanomas.  This site-specific factor presumes the denominator of 40 HPF, so just the numerator (the mitotic count) is coded here.  \n* For other schemas in which mitotic count is collected, the denominator may vary\n\n**Note 2:**  An HPF usually has a magnification objective of 40 (a 40x field).  As described in the AJCC chapter on uveal melanomas, the typical field area is 0.15 - 0.19 square millimeters (mm). (1)\n\n**Note 3:**  Record mitotic count to the nearest tenth as documented in the pathology report.  \n* For example, a mitotic count of 6/40 HPF would be coded 060\n\n**Note 4:**  Code the specific mitotic count only per 40 HPF; assume the denominator is 40 HPF if not specified.  \n* Use code 996 only if the mitotic count is expressed with a specific denominator other than 40 HPF",
