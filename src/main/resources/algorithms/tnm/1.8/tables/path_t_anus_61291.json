You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 3:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2, or T3) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS (including intramucosal, NOS)\n\n    Invades \n       Lamina propria\n       Muscularis mucosae\n       Submucosa (superficial invasion)\n       Muscularis propria (internal sphincter)\n\n    Ischiorectal fat/tissue\n    Perianal skin\n    Perirectal skin\n    Rectal mucosa or submucosa\n    Rectal wall\n    Skeletal muscle(s):\n        Anal sphincter (external)\n        Levator ani\n    Subcutaneous perianal tissue\n\n    Confined to anus\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  Code incidental finding of malignancy in hemorrhoid according to greatest extension of tumor into wall of anus. \n* Assign T1 for localized, NOS if extension not specified\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4 for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is assigned in M (distant metastasis).",
