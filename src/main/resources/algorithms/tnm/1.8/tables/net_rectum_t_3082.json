TNM does not include an in situ category for NET rectum tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:**  Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physician’s statement of the T (sub)category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 (sub)categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:** Assign the appropriate T (sub)category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS including intramucosal, NOS\n    Invades lamina propria, including lamina propria in the stalk of a polyp\n    Invades submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in the stalk of a polyp\n    Confined to and not through the muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in the stalk of a polyp\n\n    Confined to colon, NOS\n    Localized, NOS \n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4 for tumor with macroscopic adhesions to other organs or structures and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  \n* If no tumor is present in adhesions upon microscopic examination, assign the appropriate T category to describe the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases",
