  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The substantia propria is the stromal tissue of the conjunctiva underlying the epithelium.  The bulbar conjunctiva covers the eyeball, the palpebral conjunctiva lines the eyelids, and the forniceal conjunctiva covers the junction of the eyelid and eyeball. The caruncle is the fleshy prominence at the inner corner of the eye lined by conjunctival epithelium.\n\n**Note 2:**  Tumors confined to the epithelium are staged as Tis in TNM 7th Edition. Melanoma in situ (includes the term primary acquired melanosis) with atypia replacing greater than 75% of the normal epithelial thickness, with cytological features of epithelial cells, including abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, or prominent nucleoli, and/or presence of intraepithelial nests of atypical cells. (1)\n\n**Note 3:** Quadrants are defined by clock hour, starting at the limbus (e.g., 6, 9, 12, 3) extending from the central cornea, to and beyond the eyelid margins. This will bisect the carcuncle. Quadrants of involvement are coded in **Site-Specific Factor 2, Quadrants**.(1)",
