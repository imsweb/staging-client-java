  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for parotid gland tumors.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physician’s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 3:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to gland/duct of origin\n    Microscopic extraparenchymal extension ONLY to periglandular soft/connective tissue\n    Multiple foci confined to substance of parotid gland\n\n    Confined to parotid gland\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 4:** Extraparenchymal extension is clinical or macroscopic evidence of invasion of soft tissues or nerve, except those listed under T4a and T4b. Microscopic evidence alone does not constitute extraparenchymal extension for classification purposes.\n\n**Note 5:**  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones.  Mucoperiosteum is a compound structure of mucous membrane and periosteum.  Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of bone.",
