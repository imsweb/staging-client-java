TNM does not include an in situ category for NET colon tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physician’s statement of the T (sub)category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 (sub)categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:** Assign the appropriate T (sub)category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions:\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS including intramucosal, NOS\n    Invades lamina propria, including lamina propria in the stalk of a polyp\n    Invades submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in the stalk of a polyp\n    Confined to and not through the muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in the stalk of a polyp\n\n    Confined to colon, NOS\n    Localized, NOS \n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4 for tumor with macroscopic adhesions to other organs or structures and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  \n* If no tumor is present in adhesions upon microscopic examination, assign the appropriate T category to describe the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases",
