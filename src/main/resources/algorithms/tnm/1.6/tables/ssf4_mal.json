  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  *The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)* is a numerical scale used to determine how urgently a patient with liver disease needs a liver transplant within the next three months.  Results from three routine lab tests are used to calculate the MELD score.  Creatinine, one of the tests, measures kidney function; impaired kidney function is often associated with severe liver disease.\n\n**Note 2:**  Normal values may vary from lab to lab. The typical human reference ranges are 0.5 to 1.0 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl) (about 45-90 micromoles/liter (umol/l) for women and 0.7 to 1.2 mg/dl (60-110 umol/l) for men.\n\n**Note 3:**  Record the blood or serum creatinine value for this data item.\n\n**Note 4:**  Record to the nearest tenth in mg/dl or umol/l the highest creatinine value prior to treatment. \n* Record a creatinine value of 0.53 mg/dL as 005\n* Record a value of 60 umol/l as 600\n* Record a value of 110 umol/l as 980\n\n**Note 5:** Â Record the creatinine unit of measure for the same laboratory test in **Site-Specific Factor 5, Creatinine Unit of Measure**.\n\n**Note 6:**  Use code 997 if the test was done but the actual value is not stated.  Use code 997 if the test was done but the unit is not in mg/dl or umol/l.",
