  "notes" : "**Note:**  Since there is no serosa on the gallbladder on the side attached to the liver, a simple cholecystectomy may not completely remove a T2 tumor, even though such tumors are usually confined to the gallbladder. An important anatomic evaluation is that the serosa along the liver edge is more densely adherent to the liver (cystic plate) and much of this is often left behind at time of cholecystectomy. For this reason, partial hepatic resection incorporating portions of segments IVb and V is advocated for some cases.",
