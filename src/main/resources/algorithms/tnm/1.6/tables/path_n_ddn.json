  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:**  Bilateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  \n* Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 4:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are regional for TNM staging.\n\n**Note 5:** In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion.\n* In transit metastasis is coded in N (regional lymph nodes)\n\n**Note 6:** Code isolated tumor cells (ITCs) as positive nodes.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n* Head and Neck sites include bilateral or contralateral nodes\n\n**Lip (C440)**\n                                                        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS                                             \n       Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n       Nasolabial \n    Mandibular, NOS                             \n    Parotid, NOS                                         \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Submental                                         \n    Submandibular (submaxillary)             \n                \n**External ear/auditory canal (C442)**\n                                 \n    Cervical\n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)             \n    Preauricular                                             \n       \n**Face, Other (cheek, chin, forehead, jaw, nose and temple) (C443)**   \n        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS                                            \n        Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n        Nasolabial                                           \n    Mandibular, NOS                                         \n    Parotid, NOS                                         \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular     \n    Submental\n    Submandibular (submaxillary)                                    \n        \n**Scalp (C444)** \n                                                       \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical)\n                    \n**Neck (C444)**\n                                                      \n    Axillary                                                 \n    Mandibular, NOS                                          \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical) \n    Submental                   \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                    \n     \n**Trunk (C445)** \n                                                     \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Cervical                                                     \n    Internal mammary (parasternal)\n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                        \n    \n**Arm/Shoulder (C446)**\n                                                    \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Epitrochlear for hand/forearm                                \n    Spinal accessory for shoulder                                \n     \n**Leg/Hip (C447)**\n                                                         \n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Popliteal for heel and calf                                  \n     \n                                                                 \n                            \n **Bidirectional nodal involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n\n    Upper Trunk: Femoral (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)   \n    Lower Trunk: Axillary (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)\n                                                                      \n**Secondary nodal basin involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n         \n    Head and Neck: Supraclavicular                               \n    Arm/Shoulder: Supraclavicular               \n    Leg/Hip: Iliac                                                    \n    All sites: Regional lymph node(s) in secondary nodal basins, NOS\n\n**Regional lymph node(s), NOS**",
