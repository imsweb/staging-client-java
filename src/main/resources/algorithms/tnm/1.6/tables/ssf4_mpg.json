  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The location of the primary cancer site is defined by the position of the upper (proximal) edge of the tumor in the esophagus.  The distance from the incisors to the proximal edge of the tumor is collected in this Site-Specific Factor.  The location of the tumor's proximal edge within the esophagus may be described based on imaging, esophagoscopy, or surgical results.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the distance from the incisors to the proximal edge of tumor to the nearest centimeter (cm).\n\n**Note 3:**  Calculate the distance to the proximal edge of tumor if the distance to the distal edge and the length of the tumor is known.",
