Since squamous cell carcinoma typically has a poorer prognosis than adenocarcinoma, a tumor of mixed histopathologic type (including a squamous component or NOS histology) or a type that is not otherwise specified should be staged as squamous cell carcinoma. \n\n**Note 2:**  This table shows the selection of the appropriate version of the Stage table based on histology.",
