You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 3:**  Assign the appropriate T category (T1-T3) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions \n\n    Invasive tumor on one side confined to posterior one-third of tongue\n       Lamina propria\n       Submucosa\n    Anterior two-thirds of tongue for base of tongue\n    Base of tongue for lingual tonsil\n    Base of tongue tumor crosses midline\n    Floor of mouth\n    Glossoepiglottic fold\n    Glossopharyngeal fold\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Lingual tonsil for base of tongue\n    Lower gingiva\n    Midline tumor\n    Musculature, intrinsic or NOS \n    Pharyngoepiglottic fold\n    Soft palate, inferior surface or NOS including uvula\n    Sublingual gland\n    Tonsillar pillars and fossae\n    Tumor of lingual tonsil on both sides\n    Tonsils\n    Vallecula\n\n    Confined to base of tongue\n    Localized, NOS",
