Depth for Merkel cell carcinoma of skin is similar to Breslow tumor depth in melanoma of the skin.  \n* Record the actual measurement in tenths of millimeters (mm) from the pathology report\n\n**Note 2:**  If tumor depth is noted on multiple specimens (two or more), record the greatest vertical or depth measurement noted on a single specimen; do not add measurements together.  \n* Record in **Site-Specific Factor 19, Tumor Base Transection Status** that the tumor was transected \n\n**Note 3:**  If tumor is in situ (pTis), code measured thickness as 999.",
