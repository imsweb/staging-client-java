  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Direct extension to or other involvement of structures is coded in the data item SEER Mets. This includes:  sternum; skeletal muscle; skin of chest; contralateral lung or mainstem bronchus; separate tumor nodule(s) in contralateral lung.\n\n**Note 2:**  Distance from Carina:  Assume tumor is greater than or equal to 2 centimeters (cm) from carina if lobectomy, segmental resection, or wedge resection is done.\n\n**Note 3:**  Opposite Lung:  If no mention is made of the opposite lung on a chest x-ray, assume it is not involved. \n\n**Note 4:**  Bronchopneumonia:  Bronchopneumonia is not the same thing as obstructive pneumonitis and should not be coded as such.  Bronchopneumonia is an acute inflammation of the walls of the bronchioles, usually a result of spread of infection from the upper to the lower respiratory tract.  Obstructive pneumonitis is a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucous plugging, and parenchymal inflammation that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion.\n\n**Note 5:**  Pulmonary Artery/Vein:  An involved pulmonary artery/vein in the mediastinum is coded to 200 (Regional by direct extension).  However, if the involvement of the artery/vein appears to be only within lung tissue and not in the mediastinum, it is coded to 100 (Localized). \n\n**Note 6:**  Vocal cord paralysis (resulting from involvement of recurrent branch of the vagus nerve), superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor or to lymph node involvement.  Generally, code 200 is used for these manifestations.  However, if the primary tumor is peripheral and clearly unrelated to vocal cord paralysis, SVC obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, code these manifestations as mediastinal lymph node involvement (code 300) in SEER Regional Nodes, unless there is a statement of involvement by direct extension from the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 7:**  Pleural effusion and pericardial effusion are coded in SEER Mets.",
