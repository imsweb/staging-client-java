If the only information is FIGO stage IVB, leave T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of carcinomas of the corpus uteri, but TNM does. Assign pTis and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 3:** To assign a T2 category, stromal connective tissue of the cervix must be involved; endocervical glandular involvement only is not classified as a T2 tumor in TNM. \n\n**Note 4:**  Extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.",
