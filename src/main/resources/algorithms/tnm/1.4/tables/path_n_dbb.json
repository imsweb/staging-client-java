If the only information is (pathologic) FIGO stage IVB, leave pathologic T and N blank and see M\n\n**Note 2:** Histological examination of an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO classifies such cases as pNX).

Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign N1 [NOS] if regional lymph nodes are involved but the number of nodes involved is unknown.\n\n**Note 5:** Assign the appropriate N category based on the number of positive nodes\n\n    Deep inguinal, NOS\n    Femoral\n    Inguinal NOS \n    Inguinofemoral (groin) \n    Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    Superficial inguinal (femoral) \n\n    Regional lymph node(s), NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
