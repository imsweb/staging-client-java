Tumors of the tail of the pancreas arise to the left of the left edge of the aorta.\n\n**Note 2:**  Islets of Langerhans are distributed throughout the pancreas; an islet tumor is coded according to the subsite of the pancreas in which the tumor arises if the information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions\n\n    Confined to pancreas\n    Localized, NOS",
