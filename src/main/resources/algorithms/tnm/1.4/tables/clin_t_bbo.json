  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for prostate tumors.\n\n**Note 2:** **Clinically inapparent and apparent tumors**. When clinical apparency cannot be determined, assign T2.\n* **Clinically inapparent tumors** are neither palpable nor \"reliably\" visible by imaging. Physician documentation of a DRE that does not mention a palpable \"tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" can be inferred as inapparent. This would include findings limited to benign prostate enlargement/hypertrophy\n\n* **Clinically apparent tumors** are palpable or \"reliably\" visible by imaging. If a clinician documents a \"tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" by physical examination, this can be inferred as apparent. \"Tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" on imaging can only be used by the registrar if the managing clinician/urologist uses it\n* Do **not** infer inapparent or apparent tumor based on the registrar's interpretation of other terms in the DRE or imaging reports.  A physician assignment of T1 or T2 is also a clear statement of inapparent or apparent respectively.  Assign T2 in the absence of a clear physician's statement of inapparent or apparent\n\n**Note 3:** The digital rectal examination (DRE) is the \"gold standard\" for clinical staging and the quality of imaging for staging is not sufficiently uniform to make it part of routine staging. Therefore, the registrar should not use imaging to determine an apparent tumor unless the managing clinician/urologist has used it in staging (herein termed \"reliably\" visible on imaging). If there is a discrepancy between a stage documented on an imaging report and a stage documented by a managing clinician/urologist, the latter takes precedence.\n\n**Note 4:**  T1a, T1b, T1c and T1 are used only for **clinically inapparent tumors** (see Note 2) and/or incidentally found microscopic carcinoma (latent, occult) in one or both lobes.  Within this range, give priority to codes T1a and T1b over T1. Do not assign T1a, T1b or T1 [NOS] for needle core biopsy. Assign T1c when tumor is found in one lobe or both lobes by needle biopsy, but is not palpable or \"reliably\" visible by imaging. Since T1c is used to measure screening detected cases, it is important to only apply code T1c when it is clearly an inapparent case.  \n\n**Note 5:** T2a, T2b, T2c and T2 are used only for **clinically apparent tumors** (see Note 2). Information from biopsy is not used to assign T2.  Prostate biopsy information is coded in Site-Specific Factor 14. Codes T2a, T2b, and T2c have precedence over code T2. If the physician assigns cT2 without a subcategory of a, b, or c, use T2. \n\n**Note 6:**  Assign T2 for localized cancer when it is unknown if the tumor is clinically apparent. This would include cases with elevated PSA and positive needle core biopsy but no documentation regarding tumor apparency (inapparent versus apparent). Another example would be a diagnosis made prior to admission for a prostatectomy with no details provided on the initial clinical findings.\n\n**Note 7:**  T3 and T4 are used for extension beyond the prostate. Information from biopsy of extraprostatic tissue is assigned in Clinical T. \n\n**Note 8:** Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the T code.\n\n**Note 9:** \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign a description of frozen pelvis to code T4.\n\n**Note 10:** When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during prostatectomy for other reasons: If there is documentation regarding a normal prostate evaluation (physical examination or imaging) prior to prostatectomy/autopsy of an invasive tumor, assign T0 in Clinical T. \n* If there is no documentation regarding a normal prostate evaluation (physical examination or imaging) prior to prostatectomy/autopsy of an invasive tumor, assign blank in Clinical T\n\n**Note 11:** Invasion into the prostatic apex or into (but not beyond) the prostatic capsule is not classified as T3, but as T2.",
