The outer muscular coat (muscularis) is absent in most of the male urethra except for the membranous portion. In females, the muscle coat is continuous from the bladder wall. In addition, in both males and females, there is sphincteric muscle, which may be smooth or skeletal muscle. Invasion of periurethral muscle, sphincter muscle or muscle at the neck are all assigned 200 for regional.",
