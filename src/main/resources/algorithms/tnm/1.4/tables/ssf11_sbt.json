It is of particular importance for mucinous carcinomas (morphology codes 8480, 8481, and 8490).\n\n**Note 2:** Select the code for the highest grade from the primary tumor tissue as described on the pathology report prior to neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n**Note 3:**  The term \"undifferentiated\" should not apply to mucinous tumors because a tumor that makes mucin is, by definition, differentiated into mucin-producing tumor cells.",
