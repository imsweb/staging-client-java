  "notes" : "**Note 1:** The pathologic classification requires the resection and examination of at least the low axillary lymph nodes (Level I). Such a resection will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**   Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes such as cervical (excluding supraclavicular) or contralateral axillary and/or contralateral internal mammary are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:** Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is classified as a clinical N, e.g., cN1. Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or sentinel lymph node biopsy only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment. \n\n**Note 4:** The breast lymphatics drain by way of three major routes: axillary, transpectoral, and internal mammary. Internal mammary lymph nodes reside within breast tissue and are coded as axillary lymph nodes for staging purposes. Supraclavicular lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph nodes for staging purposes. \n\n**Note 5:** Assign N1 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Axillary (ipsilateral):** Interpectoral Rotter nodes and lymph nodes along the axillary vein and its tributaries, which may be divided into the following levels \n\n    Level I (low-axilla)\n       Lymph nodes lateral to the lateral border of pectoralis minor muscle\n    Level II (mid-axilla): lymph nodes between: \n       Medial lateral borders of the pectoralis minor muscle and interpectoral (Rotter's) lymph nodes\n    Level III (apical axilla)\n       Lymph nodes medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle and inferior to the clavicle\n       Infraclavicular (subclavicular) nodes\n    The infraclavicular designation may be used for level III nodes to differentiate these nodes from the remaining \n     level I and II axillary nodes\n   \n**Internal mammary (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the intercostal spaces along the end of the sternum in the endothoracic fascia\n\n**Supraclavicular (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa: A triangle defined by the omohyoid muscle and tendon (lateral and superior border) \n    \n**Intrammary** \n\n     Lymph nodes within the breast: Intrammary lymph nodes are coded as axillary lymph nodes level I\n\n**Note 6:**  Micrometastases are defined as tumor deposits greater than 0.2 millimeter (mm) but not greater than 2.0 mm in largest dimension.  Macrometastases are tumor deposits greater than 2.0 mm.  All nodes with at least micrometastases are included in the count of positive lymph nodes, but at least one node must contain a macrometastasis for assignment of a pathologic N category greater than pN1mi.\n\n**Note 7:**  If the pathology report indicates that nodes are positive but size of the metastases is not stated, assume the metastases are greater than 0.2 mm and code the lymph nodes as positive in this field.  \n\n**Note 8:**  Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected only by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods but which may be verified on hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stains.  ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction). Lymph nodes with ITCs only are not classified as positive lymph nodes.  If the record only states N0(i+), assign N0 and see Site-Specific Factor 4.(2)",
