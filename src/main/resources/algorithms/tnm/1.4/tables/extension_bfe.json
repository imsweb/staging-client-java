  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 2:**  A physician's statement may be used to code SEER Primary Tumor if this is the only information in the medical record.  Assign as localized when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 3:** Assign as localized only if GIST is described as arising in a polyp.  Do not assign as localized if GIST described as arising in the wall of the colon and extending into the lumen with a polypoid appearance.\n\n**Note 4:** Assign as localized (code 100) only if no other information is available.\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign as regional for tumor with macroscopic adhesions to other organs or structures and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  However, if no tumor is present in adhesion(s) upon microscopic examination, assign a lower Summary Stage which defines the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases (excluding adherence to liver, see Note 6).\n\n**Note 6:**  Adherence to the liver capsule is not considered distant. Assign as regional for any adherence to the liver capsule.\n\n**Note 7:**  Assign as regional for contiguous extension from the site of origin.  Discontiguous involvement is assigned to SEER Mets.",
