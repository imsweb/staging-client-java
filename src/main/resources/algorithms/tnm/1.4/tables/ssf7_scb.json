Milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl) is the unit of measure commonly used in the United States. Micromoles/liter (umol/l) is the designated Systeme International (SI) unit of measure commonly used in Canada and Europe.\n\n**Note 2:**  If the test was done but the total bilirubin unit of measure is not stated, code 997.\n\n**Note 3:**  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in **Site-Specific Factor 6, Total Bilirubin Value** and **Site Specific Factor 7, Total Bilirubin Unit of Measure**.",
