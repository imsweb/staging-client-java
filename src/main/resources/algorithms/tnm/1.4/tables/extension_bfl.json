  "notes" : "**Note 1:** When both FIGO stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO Stage IV, NOS is assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  \n\n**Note 3:** Positive cytology is a staging element for Summary Stage. Since \"cancer cells in ascites or in peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, is unclear to which stage previous cases may have been coded in that staging system. \n\n**Note 4:**  Adnexa is defined as the tubes, ovaries and ligament(s).\n\n**Note 5:**  “Frozen pelvis” is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a statement of involvement, code as regional by direct extension.  In both the Historic Stage and the 1977 Summary Staging Guide “frozen pelvis”  was considered distant.\n\n**Note 6:** Extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.\n\n**Note 7:** If the clinician says “adnexa palpated” but doesn’t mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.\n\n**Note 8:**  If either exploratory/definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume nodes are negative.\n\n**Note 9:** Sounding of the corpus is no longer a  prognostic factor.",
