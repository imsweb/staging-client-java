This schema should not be used for secondary lymphomatous involvement of ocular adnexa or for intraocular lymphomas.\n\n**Note 2:** Preseptal eyelid involvement includes infiltration of the outer three layers of the eyelid: skin, subcutaneous connective tissue, and orbicularis oculi muscle.\n\n**Note 3:** The orbit is the bony cavity containing the eye, lacrimal gland, lacrimal sac, nasolacrimal duct, extraocular muscles, fat. arteries, veins, and nerves, but no lymphatics.",
