High grade dysplasia is generally not reportable in cancer registries; but if a registry does collect high grade dysplasia, code 000 should be used. \n\n**Note 3:** Linitis plastica is defined as diffuse involvement of the entire stomach wall and coded as localized in Summary Stage\n\n**Note 4:**  Discontinous involvement is considered metastatic with the exception of implants within the stomach which are considered localized in Summary  Stage.",
