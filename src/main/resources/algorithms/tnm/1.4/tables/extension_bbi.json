FIGO Stage IVA is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement. \n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO Stage I, IA and IB are defined by size of tumor, involvement of vulva OR vulva and perineum, and depth of stromal invasion and are included as localized disease if only the vulva is involved and as regional if both the vulva and perineum are involved.",
