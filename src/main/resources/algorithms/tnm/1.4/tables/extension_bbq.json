  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The cortex of a bone is the dense outer shell that provides strength to the bone; the spongy center of a bone is the cancellous portion.  The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.\n\n**Note 2:**  The term \"skip metastasis\" is not used with a consistent meaning in the literature.  In some cases, it refers to discontinuous metastasis in the same bone as the primary tumor, while in other cases it refers to discontinuous metastasis in an adjacent bone, usually in the same limb.",
