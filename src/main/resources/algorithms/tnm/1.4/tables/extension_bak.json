  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Changes such as dimpling of the skin, tethering, and nipple retraction are caused by tension on Cooper's ligament(s), not by actual skin involvement. They do not alter the classification.\n\n**Note 2:** Consider adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening as clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue; code regional by direct extension. \n\n**Note 3:** Consider “fixation, NOS” as involvement of pectoralis muscle; code regional by direct extension.\n\n**Note 4:** Inflammatory carcinoma is applied to a patient with neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course of the disease and is coded to 200 (regional). Clinical findings involve the majority of the skin of the breast.",
