TNM does not include an in situ category for NET small intestine tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:**  The nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue is, for jejunum and ileum, part of the mesentery and, for duodenum in areas where serosa is lacking, part of the retroperitoneum.\n\n**Note 4:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâ€™s statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX\n\n**Note 5:** Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions:\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS including intramucosal, NOS\n    Invades lamina propria, including lamina propria in the stalk of a polyp\n    Invades submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in the stalk of a polyp\n    Confined to and not through the muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in the stalk of a polyp\n\n    Confined to colon, NOS\n    Localized, NOS \n\n**Note 6:**  Assign T4 for tumor with macroscopic adhesions to other organs or structures and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  \n* If no tumor is present in adhesions upon microscopic examination, use lower codes to describe the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases",
