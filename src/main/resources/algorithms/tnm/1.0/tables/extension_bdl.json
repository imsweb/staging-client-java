  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Superficial erosion alone of bone/tooth socket by gingival primary is not sufficient to code as bone involvement. \n\n**Note 2:**  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones.  Mucoperiosteum is a compound structure of mucous membrane and periosteum.  Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of bone. Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.",
