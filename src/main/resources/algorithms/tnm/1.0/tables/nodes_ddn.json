  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  \n\n**Note 2:**  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are considered regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for TNM staging but may be distant for Summary Stage. \n\n**Note 4:**  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded to Regional Lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 5:**  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be considered negative nodes for Summary Stage 2000.",
