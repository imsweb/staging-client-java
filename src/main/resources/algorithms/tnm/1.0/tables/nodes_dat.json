  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in SEER Mets.\n\n**Note 2:**  Regional lymph nodes for any part of the esophagus fall in the range from periesophageal/cervical to the celiac region.  Contralateral and bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes are included.  However, TNM has clarified that some nodal chains in this large area are partially regional and partially distant because they include both nodes that are close to the esophagus toward the body's midline and nodes that run laterally away from the esophagus or perpendicular to it.  Regional nodes are those that lie in the bed of the esophagus.  Examples:  regional supraclavicular nodes (level 1), regional pulmonary ligament nodes (level 9), regional hilar tracheobronchial nodes (level 10), or regional diaphragmatic nodes (level 15) are only those nodes closest to the esophagus; nodes in these chains that are further from the esophagus are distant.  Medical record terminology is unlikely to be so specific in describing involved node locations, so try to correlate involved node information with staging statements that indicate whether the nodes were considered regional or distant by the physicians; lacking such physician guidance, presume regional nodes.  If the record just indicates involvement of supraclavicular nodes, for example, and there is no further information available, presume that the involved nodes were close to the esophagus and regional.\n\n**Note 3:**  Imaging studies often refer to involved nodes in the gastrohepatic ligament or at the gastrohepatic level for esophageal primaries.  Code as left gastric nodes if there is no more specific information.",
