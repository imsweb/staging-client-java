  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  When both FIGO stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO Stage IIIB is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement; FIGO Stage IV, NOS is assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code SEER Primary Tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIB or FIGO Stage IV [NOS] only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.  Code a statement of FIGO Stage IIIB in SEER Lymph Nodes  if unknown is based on extension.  Code a stage of FIGO Stage IV [NOS] in SEER Mets if unknown is based on extension.\n\n**Note 3:**  FIGO no longer includes Stage 0 for this site. \n\n**Note 4:**  All macroscopically visible lesions, even with superficial invasion, are coded to localized (code 100) for FIGO Stage IB\n\n**Note 5:**  Involvement of the anterior and/or posterior septum, the tissue between the vagina and bladder and between the vagina and rectum, is coded as involvement of the vaginal wall.\n\n**Note 6:** \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s). In the absence of a statement of involvement, code as regional (code 200). In both the Historic Stage and the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, \"frozen pelvis\" was considered distant.",
