  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The lacrimal sac is the upper dilated end of the nasolacrimal duct, lodged in a deep groove formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. The sac connects the lacrimal canaliculi, which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the nasolacrimal duct, which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity. The most common epithelial tumors of the lacrimal sac are squamous cell and transitional cell carcinomas.\n\n**Note 2:**  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones.",
