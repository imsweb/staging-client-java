  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Superficial lesions are located entirely in the subcutaneous tissues without any degree of extension through the muscular fascia or into underlying muscle.  \n\n**Note 2:**  Deep lesions are located partly or completely within one or more muscle groups within the extremity. Deep tumors may extend through the muscular fascia into the subcutaneous tissues or even to the skin but the critical criterion is location of any portion of the tumor within the muscular components of the extremity. \n\n**Note 3:**  For tumors of the extremities and trunk ONLY, superficial lesions are defined as those not involving the superficial muscular fascia.  Deep lesions are those that involve or are beneath the superficial fascia. \n\n**Note 4:**  Intraperitoneal visceral lesions, retroperitoneal lesions, and intrathoracic lesions, and the majority of head and neck tumors are considered deep lesions.  \n\n**Note 5:**  Adjacent connective tissue is defined as the unnamed tissues that immediately surround an organ or structure containing a primary cancer. Code regional (200) when a tumor has invaded past the outer border (capsule, serosa, or other edge) of the primary organ into the organ's surrounding supportive structures but has not invaded into larger structures or adjacent organs. Blood, cartilage, and bone are sometimes considered connective tissues, but they are coded separately.  \n\n**Note 6:** Connective tissue includes adipose tissue; aponeuroses; arteries; blood vessels; bursa; connective tissue, NOS; fascia; fatty tissue; fibrous tissue; ligaments; lymphatic channels (not nodes); muscle; skeletal muscle; subcutaneous tissue; synovia; tendons; tendon sheaths; veins; and vessels, NOS. \n\n**Note 7:** Peripheral nerves and autonomic nervous system includes: ganglia, nerve, parasympathetic nervous system, peripheral nerve, spinal nerve, sympathetic nervous system.\n\n**Note 8:** If an involved vessel has a name, for example, brachial artery or recurrent laryngeal nerve, consider it an adjacent structure, and code as regional by direct extension.",
