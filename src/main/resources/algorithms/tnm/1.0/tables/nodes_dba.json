For the upper two thirds of vagina, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes are coded in SEER Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO Stage III is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement. Code 300 if FIGO Stage III is based on lymph node involvement. See SEER Primary Tumor if FIGO stage III is based on extension or unknown.",
