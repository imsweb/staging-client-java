  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  High grade dysplasia and severe dysplasia are generally not reportable in cancer registries, but if a registry does collect these, code in situ.\n\n**Note 2:** In situ includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial); localized includes confined to lamina propria (intramucosal), the muscular mucosa, and muscularis propria. \n\n**Note 3:** Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:** For contiguous extension from the site of origin, code as regional if the contiguous extension is to a regional site and code in SEER Mets if it is to a site not listed under regional. Discontinuous involvement is coded in SEER Mets (distant metastasis.) \n\n**Note 5:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures macroscopically or microscopically is coded as regional if the organ or structure is listed as regional. \n\n**Note 6:** Terminology such as \"Transmural, NOS\" and \"Extension through the wall, NOS\" typically means that the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria but has not necessarily invaded the entire thickness of the colon wall.",
