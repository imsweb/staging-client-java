Distant nodes, including presacral and lateral sacral (laterosacral) nodes, are coded in SEER Mets.\n\n**Note 2:**  The Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code positive regional nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is know that the stage value is assigned because of positive lymph nodes. \n\n**Note 3:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume nodes are negative. \n\n**Note 4:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.",
