  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a tumor marker that has value in the management of epithelial appendiceal malignancies with peritoneal dissemination.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record to the nearest tenth in Unit/milliliter (U/mL) the highest CA 19-9 lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment.  For example, code a pre-treatment CA 19-9 value of 60 U/mL as 600.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 U/mL (no measurable amount of CA 19-9).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 U/mL; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 U/mL should be coded 001.  For code 001, also round 0.11-0.14 U/mL down to 0.1 U/mL.  For codes 002-980, round values to the nearest tenth of a U/ml.\n\n**Note 4**:  Use code 997 if an interpretation is documented but the actual lab value is not available in the record.",
