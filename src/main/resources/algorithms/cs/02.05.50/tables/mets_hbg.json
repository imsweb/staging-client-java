  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Periesophageal lymph nodes extending from the cervical/supraclavicular region to the celiac region previously considered to be distant are now classified as regional nodes.  Involvement of these nodes is coded in CS Lymph Nodes.\n\n**Note 2**:  Lymph node stations/groups are listed in parentheses where applicable.  For a list of these nodal groups, see Part I Section 2 or Figure 10.3 from the AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas, 2nd Ed. or errata for AJCC 7th Ed. chapter 10.\n\n**Note 3**:  Errata for AJCC 7th Ed. has clarified the status of the most distal node chains for the esophagus/esophagogastric junction chapter.  The left gastric and celiac nodes (levels 17, 20) are regional, but the common hepatic and splenic artery nodes (levels 18, 19) are not regional.  The common hepatic and splenic nodes continue to be captured in code 15.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Mets at DX codes 00 or 99, the N and M categories for AJCC 6 staging are assigned based on the coding of CS Lymph Nodes as shown in the Lymph Nodes Mets at DX AJCC 6 Table.",
