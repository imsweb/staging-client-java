Record the tertiary pattern prior to neoadjuvant treatment. If a tertiary pattern is documented on needle core biopsy or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), it should be disregarded. Do not code the tertiary pattern on prostatectomy or autopsy in CS Site-Specific Factor 9 or CS Site-Specific Factor 10.",
