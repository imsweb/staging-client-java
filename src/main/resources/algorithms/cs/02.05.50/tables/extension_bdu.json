  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  AJCC does not include an in situ category for carcinoid tumors of appendix.  Any case so coded will be mapped to TX for AJCC 7 stage and in situ Summary Stage.  Cases coded with 000 will continue to map to Tis if AJCC 6 staging is applicable.\n\n**Note 2**: The assignment of T1, T1a, and T1b categories for carcinoid of appendix is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category. Use code 320, 330, or 335, 410, 490, or 850 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 3**:  Codes 405-750 are used for contiguous extension from the site of origin.  Discontinuous involvement is coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 4**:  Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is classified cT4b. If tumor is present in adhesion(s) upon microscopic examination, the tumor is classified as pT4b.  Use code 565 for macroscopic adhesions if no pathologic confirmation, and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  However, if no tumor is present in adhesion(s) upon microscopic examination, the classification is based upon extent of tumor invasion into or through the wall; use codes 000, 100, 160, 200, 370, 451, and 470 as appropriate to describe the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases. Use codes 601-650, 670, 701, and 751-800 to code invasion of underlying structures from the adherent tumor.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-120, 160-300, 320-335, 370, 401-410, and  451 ONLY, the T category is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 7 Table for this schema.",
