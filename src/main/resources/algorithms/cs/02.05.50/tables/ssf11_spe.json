Record the actual measurement in tenths of millimeters (mm) as stated on the pathology report.  Do not record the measurement from a radiographic report.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the measurement labeled specifically as thickness or depth of tumor.  In the absence of a label, use the \"cut surface\" dimension, or the third dimension from a description of 3 dimensions (N1 x N2 x N3).  For example, for a tumor size recorded as 2 centimeters (cm) x 1cm x 0.5 cm, record 050.",
