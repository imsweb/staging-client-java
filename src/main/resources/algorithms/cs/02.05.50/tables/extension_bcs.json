  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The substantia propria is the stromal tissue of the conjunctiva underlying the epithelium.  The bulbar conjunctiva covers the eyeball, the palpebral conjunctiva lines the eyelids, and the forniceal conjunctiva covers the junction of the eyelid and eyeball.  The caruncle is the fleshy prominence at the inner corner of the eye lined by conjunctival epithelium.\n\n**Note 2**:  Tumors confined to the epithelium are staged as Tis in AJCC 7th Edition. Unless corneal extension is present, they are staged as T1 in AJCC 6th Edition.\n\n**Note 3**:  Quadrants of involvement are coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 300-335, 445-450, and 470-500, the pathologic T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval and thickness recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 1, as shown in the Pathologic Eval Extension Thickness AJCC 7 Table (eval codes 2, 3, 6, 8). The Pathologic Eval Extension Thickness AJCC 7 Table is also used if the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval code is blank and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 does not equal 998. The clinical T category is assigned based on the value of CS TS/Ext Eval and quadrants recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2, as shown in the Clinical Eval Extension Quadrants AJCC 7 Table (eval codes 0, 1, 5, 9). The Clinical Eval Extension Quadrants AJCC 7 Table is also used if the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval code is blank and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 equals 998.\n- For CS Extension codes 710- 740, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval as shown in the Eval Extension T3 AJCC 7 Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 005, 305-335, 415, and 425-435, the pathologic T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval and thickness recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Pathologic Eval Extension Thickness AJCC 6 Table (eval codes 2, 3, 6, 8). The Pathologic Eval Extension Thickness AJCC 6 Table is also used if the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval code is blank and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 does not equal 998. The clinical T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval as shown in the Clinical Eval Extension AJCC 6 Table (eval codes 0,1, 5, 9) for this schema. The Clinical Eval Extension AJCC 6 Table is also used if the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval code is blank and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 equals 998.",
