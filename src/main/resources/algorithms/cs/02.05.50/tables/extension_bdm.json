  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Superficial erosion alone of bone/tooth socket by gingival primary is not sufficient to code as bone involvement (code 700).\n\n**Note 2**:  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones. Mucoperiosteum is a compound structure of muccous membrane and periosteum. Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of bone. .  Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 3**:  AJCC assigns the T category based on size when bone involvement is limited to the cortex.  Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a.\n\n**Note 4**:  The assignment of T1, T2 , and T3 categories for tumors of the lip and oral cavity is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category. Use codes 405, 410, 415, 775, 810, or 815 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 5**:  Use code 300 for localized tumor only if no information is available to assign code 100, 405, 410, or 415.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-650  ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-650  ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 Edition staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.",
