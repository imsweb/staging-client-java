Procedures used in clinical staging include digital rectal examination (DRE) and imaging techniques of the prostate.  Imaging includes transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (erMRI).\n\n**Note 2**: Record the procedure(s) used in clinical staging for all T categories regardless of positive or negative findings.  Record TRUS-guided biopsy as imaging.\n\n**Note 3**:  Clinical procedures performed after needle core biopsy or any surgical procedure of the prostate are not included in this field.",
