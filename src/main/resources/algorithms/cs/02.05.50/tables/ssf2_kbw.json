This might include: physical examination, imaging, diagnostic lymph node biopsy and exploratory surgery (without a resection).  \n\n**Note 2**:  In the rare instance that the number of clinically positive nodes is stated but a clinical N category is not stated, code 1-3 nodes as 100 (clinical N1), and 4 or more nodes as 200 (clinical N2).\n\n**Note 3**:  If there is no diagnostic work-up to assess regional lymph nodes, use code 999.  Do not apply the inaccessible nodes rule that presumes unmentioned nodes to be negative.",
