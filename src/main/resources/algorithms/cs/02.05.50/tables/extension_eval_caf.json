Staging laparotomy and pathological staging have been essentially abandoned as useful procedures.\" (7th ed., page 610)  Therefore, Collaborative Staging uses a modified evaluation scheme for lymphomas, and it applies to the CS Tumor Size/Ext-Eval field only.  The other Eval fields are coded as \"not applicable\" for this schema.",
