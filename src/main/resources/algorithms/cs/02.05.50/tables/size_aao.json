A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category.  Use codes 994, 996-998 as appropriate to code CS Tumor Size based on a statement of T when no other size information is available.",
