This table shows the selection of the appropriate version of the AJCC Stage table based on histology.  \"Ewing\" maps to the table AJCC TNM 6 and 7 Stage Ewing, which is used to derive stage group for both AJCC 6 and AJCC 7 staging.  \"Not Ewing\" maps to the tables AJCC TNM 6 Stage Not Ewing and AJCC TNM 7 Stage Not Ewing for deriving AJCC 6and AJCC 7 stage group, respectively.",
