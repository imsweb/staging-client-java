  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris.\n\n**Note 2**:  AJCC does not recognize in situ melanoma of the choroid.  Any case so coded will be mapped to unknown AJCC stage and in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 3**:  The AJCC 7th Edition assigns a T value to combinations of measurements for basal diameter and thickness of tumor divided into four Tumor Size Categories in a charted format.  The AJCC 6th Edition assigned T values based on three pairs of measurements for basal diameter and thickness, using the basal diameter for classification when the two measurements did not fit into the defined pairs.\n\n**Note 4**:  According to the AJCC, \"In clinical practice the largest tumor basal diameter may be estimated in optic disc diameters (dd) (average: 1 dd = 1.5mm). Tumor thickness may be estimated in diopters (average: 2.5 diopters = 1 mm).  However, techniques, such as ultrasonography and fundus photography are used to provide more accurate measurements.\"\n\n**Note 5**:  Use codes 150 through 180 if measurements are available to record the largest tumor basal diameter and tumor thickness.  Only use codes 205 through 445 or 640 if measurements are not available for coding.  Note that code 635, mapped to T4e, is not based on a Tumor Size Category assignment.\n\n**Note 6**:  Only use codes 245, 295, 345, and 445 if the tumor size category is the only information available about the tumor.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 150-180, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the values of tumor basal diameter, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2, and thickness, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 3. Basal diameter and thickness are mapped to Tumor Size Categories in the Tumor Size Category AJCC 7 Table, and the CS Extension codes and Tumor Size Categories are mapped to T in the Extension Size Category AJCC 7 Table.\n- For CS Extension codes 150-180, 635, and 640, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the values of tumor basal diameter, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2, and thickness, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 3. Basal diameter and thickness are mapped to tumor size pairs in the Tumor Size Pair AJCC 6 Table, and the CS Extension codes and tumor size pairs are mapped to T in the Extension Size Pair AJCC 6 Table.",
