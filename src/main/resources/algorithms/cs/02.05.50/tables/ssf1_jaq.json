  "notes" : "**Note 1**: Stage for gestational trophoblastic tumors is anatomically defined, but the Prognostic Scoring Index is used to substage patients. Substage A (low risk) and Substage B (high risk) are assigned on the basis of a non-anatomic risk factor scoring system:\n\n     Age: \n          Score 0: Age less than 40 \n          Score 1: Age equal to or greater than 40 \n     Antecedent Pregnancy:\n          Score 0: Hydatidiform mole \n          Score 1: Abortion \n          Score 2: Term pregnancy \n     Interval Months from Index Pregnancy:\n          Score 0: Less than 4 months\n          Score 1: 4-6 months \n          Score 2: 7-12 months \n          Score 4: More than 12 months \n     Pretreatment Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (IU/ml):\n          Score 0: Less than 10 to 3rd power (1,000)\n          Score 1: 10 to 3rd power to less than 10 to 4th power (1,000 to less than 10,000) \n          Score 2: 10 to 4th power to less than 10 to 5th power (10,000 to less than 100,000) \n          Score 4: Equal to or greater than  10 to 5th power (100,000 or greater) \n     Largest Tumor Size, Including Uterus: \n          Score 0: Less than 3 cm\n          Score 1: 3 cm to 5 cm';\n          Score 2: Equal to or greater than 5 cm\n     Sites of Metastases:  \n          Score 0: Lung only or none\n          Score 1: Spleen, kidney\n          Score 2: Gastrointestinal tract\n          Score 4: Liver, brain \n     Number of Metastases Identified:\n          Score 0: 0\n          Score 1: 1-4\n          Score 2: 5-8\n          Score 4: Greater than 8 \n     Previous Failed Chemotherapy:\n          Score 2: Single drug\n          Score 4: 2 or more drugs\n\n**Note 2**:  Clinician scoring is recommended, but the score may be assigned if clinician scoring is unavailable.\n\n**Note 3**:  Sum the score of the prognostic risk factors to determine the final Prognostic Scoring Index. If any one of the factors is unknown, do not assign score, unless low risk or high risk can be determined with the information available.",
