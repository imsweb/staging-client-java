  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker that has value in the management of certain malignancies.\n\n**Note 2**:  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in CS Site-Specific Factors 13 and 14.\n\n**Note 3**:  Record to the nearest tenth in nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) the highest CEA lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment. For example, a pretreatment CEA of 7.34 ng/ml would be recorded as 073.\n\n**Note 4**:  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 ng/ml (no measurable amount of CEA).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 ng/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 ng/ml should be coded 001.  For code 001, also round 0.11-0.14 ng/ml down to 0.1 ng/ml.  For codes 002-980, round values to the nearest tenth of a ng/ml.\n\n**Note 5**:  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  For example, code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 ng/ml\" as 005.",
