  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Record the results of only the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in this field.  The test determines if there are additional copies of the HER2/neu gene in the tumor cells compared to the normal number.  The results are reported as a ratio between the number of copies of the HER2/neu gene and the number of copies of chromosome 17, on which the gene resides.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the actual ratio if given.  Enter the stated ratio to two decimal places.  Use a trailing zero if needed.\n\n**Note 3**:  The same laboratory test should be used to record information in CS Site-Specific Factors 10 and 11.\n\n**Note 4**:  If the test is done but the actual ratio is not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 5**:  If the test is not mentioned in the medical record, code to 999 unless there are circumstances under which the test isn't performed, for example no histologic specimen.",
