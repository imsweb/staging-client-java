  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with the greatest extension.\n\n**Note 2**:  Skin ulceration does not alter the AJCC T category.\n\n**Note 3**:  In-transit metastasis is coded in CS Lymph Nodes.\n\n**Note 4**: The assignment of the T1, T2, and T3 categories for Merkel cell carcinomas is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code both CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. However the two fields are coded independently; for example, the record may document size but not extension.  Use codes 600, 610, 620, and 810 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100, 400, 500, 600, 610, and 620 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100, 400, 500, 600, 610, and 620 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.",
