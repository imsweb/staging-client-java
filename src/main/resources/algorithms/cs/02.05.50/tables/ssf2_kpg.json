Weight loss: Unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of the usual body weight in the 6 months prior to diagnosis.\n\n**Note 2**:  Pruritus alone does not qualify for B classification, nor does alcohol intolerance, fatigue, or a short, febrile illness associated with suspected infections.\n\n**Note 3**:  Use code 000 if the History and Physical, progress notes, or consultations make no mention of B symptoms.",
