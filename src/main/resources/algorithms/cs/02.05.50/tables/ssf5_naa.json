ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction.)\n\n**Note 2**:  Use codes 000-002 only to report results of MOL studies (RT-PCR) when CS Lymph Nodes is coded 000.  Otherwise code 987 in this field.\n\n**Note 3**:  If it is not stated whether molecular tests are done, assume they are not done.",
