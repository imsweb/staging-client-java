  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code the Gleason's primary and secondary patterns from prostatectomy or autopsy only in this field.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the Gleason's primary and secondary patterns prior to neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n**Note 3**:  Usually prostate cancers are graded using Gleason's score or pattern.  Gleason's grading for prostate primaries is based on a 5-component system (5 histologic patterns).  Prostatic cancer generally shows two main histologic patterns.  The primary pattern, the pattern occupying greater than 50% of the cancer, is usually indicated by the first number of the Gleason's grade, and the secondary pattern is usually indicated by the second number.  These two numbers are added together to create a pattern score, ranging from 2 to 10.\n\n* If there are two numbers, assume that they refer to two patterns (the first number being the primary pattern and the second number the secondary pattern) and sum them to obtain the score.   \n* If only one number is given and it is less than or equal to 5, assume that it describes a pattern.  Code the number as the primary pattern and code the secondary pattern as 9.\n* If only one number is given and it is greater than 5, assume that it is a score.  Code 099.    \n* If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score.  Example:  The pathology report says Gleason's 3/10.  The Gleason's score would be 3, and coded as 099.\n\n**Note 4**:  If prostatectomy and autopsy are not performed, assign code 998. If the Gleason's pattern and score are not documented on prostatectomy or autopsy, assign code 999.\n\n**Note 5**:  If a tertiary pattern is documented on prostatectomy or autopsy, do not code in either CS Site-Specific Factor 9 or CS Site-Specific Factor 10. Record the tertiary pattern in CS Site-Specific Factor 11.",
