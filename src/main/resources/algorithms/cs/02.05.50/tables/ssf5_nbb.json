  "notes" : "**Note**:  The microsatellite instability (MSI) test is a genetic test performed on tumor tissue to look for differences in length of certain non-functioning sections of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  The differences are caused by problems with the genes that normally repair DNA.    A high-positive MSI (MSI-H) result may indicate that the gene repair problem is related to the development of the cancer, and that the patient may have hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome.  A low-positive or stable MSI result (stable meaning that there are no differences in the lengths) means it is unlikely that the cancer is related to a hereditary condition.",
