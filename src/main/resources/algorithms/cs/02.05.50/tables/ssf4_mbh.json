  "notes" : "**Note 1**: The CD4 cell count is used to monitor how well the immune system is working in a patient who is Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive.  A blood test measures the number of CD4 T-cells in each microliter (ul) of blood. The measurement may also be in CD4 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. One microliter (ul) is equivalent to 1 cubic millimeter of fluid. A low CD4 count (less than 200) indicates a weakened immune system. For Kaposi Sarcoma patients, a CD4 count lower than 200 is a poor risk factor.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the CD4 count at the time of the Kaposi Sarcoma diagnosis as documented in the patient record. If the CD4+ count is 980 or greater use code 980.  If the test is done but the actual value is not available or not stated, use code 997.\n\n**Note 3**:  If the patient is HIV negative, use code 987.\n\n**Note 4**:  Record the actual value of the CD4 count as documented in the patient record. If the actual CD4+ count is 980 or greater, use code 980.",
