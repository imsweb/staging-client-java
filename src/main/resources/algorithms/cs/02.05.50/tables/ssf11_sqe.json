  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a disease that damages and blocks bile ducts inside and outside the liver. In PSC, inflammation of the bile ducts leads to scar formation and narrowing of the ducts over time. As scarring increases, the ducts become blocked. As a result, bile builds up in the liver and damages liver cells. Eventually, scar tissue can spread throughout the liver, causing cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code stated diagnosis of PSC either clinically or pathologically as documented in the medical record. This may be by history.\n\n**Note 3**:  If a medical history and/or pathology report is available and PSC is not mentioned, record 000 as absence of PSC. If the medical history and pathology report are not documented in the record or the record is not available, record 999 for unknown.",
