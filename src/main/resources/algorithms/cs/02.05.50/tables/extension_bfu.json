  "notes" : "**Note**:  The assignment of T categories for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category.  Use codes 350. 360, 370, and 380 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.",
