Record actual measurement in hundredths of millimeters from the pathology report.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the greatest measured thickness from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with a thickness of 0.50 mm is followed by a re-excision with a thickness of residual tumor of 0.20 mm, code 050.  Do not add measurements together from different procedures.",
