  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Bronchopneumonia is not the same thing as obstructive pneumonitis and should not be coded as such. \n* Bronchopneumonia is an acute inflammation of the walls of the bronchioles, usually a result of spread of infection from the upper to the lower respiratory tract\n* Obstructive pneumonitis is a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucous plugging, and parenchymal inflammation that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion\n\n**Note 2:** Code 100 only applies to predominantly lepidic pattern (AIS) tumors with a small focus of invasion. \n\n**Note 3:** Atelectasis is the failure of the lung to expand (inflate) completely. This may be caused by a blocked airway, a tumor, general anesthesia, pneumonia or other lung infections, lung disease, or long-term bed rest with shallow breathing. Sometimes called a collapsed lung. \n* For staging purposes, atelectasis must present with an obstructing tumor\n\n**Note 4:** Specific information about visceral pleura invasion is captured in codes 450 (PL1 and PL2) and 500 (PL3).  Elastic layer involvement has prognostic significance for lung cancer. \n\n**Note 5:** Penetration of the visceral pleura indicates a progression of invasion, even in small (≤ 3cm) tumors, and indicates a less favorable prognosis. Visceral pleural invasion is considered present both in tumors that extend to the visceral pleural surface (type PL2 invasion), and in tumors that penetrate beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura (type PL1 invasion). Further invasion, which extends to the parietal pleura, is also described as type PL3 invasion.\n\n**Note 6:** Separate ipsilateral tumor nodules of the same histopathological type (intrapulmonary metastases) are coded either 500 (same lobe) or 700 (different ipsilateral lobe). Separate tumor nodules in the contralateral lung are assigned in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 7:** Occult carcinoma occurs when tumor is proven by the presence of malignant cells or bronchial washings, but there is no other evidence of the tumor. In these cases, assign EOD Primary Tumor 980, EOD Regional Nodes 000, and EOD Mets 00.",
