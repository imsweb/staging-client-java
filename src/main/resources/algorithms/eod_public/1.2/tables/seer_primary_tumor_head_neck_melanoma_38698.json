  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Mucosal melanomas occur throughout the mucosa of the lip and oral cavity (C003-C005, C008-C069, C090-C148) and the nasal cavity and middle ear (C300-C301), accessory sinuses (C310-C319) and the larynx (C320-C329). For a more detailed description of anatomy, refer to the appropriate EOD schema based on the location of the mucosal melanoma. \n\n**Note 2:** Code 100 for localized tumors when no other information is available or for extension involving the mucosa only of adjacent sites.\n\n**Note 3:** Extension involving the deeper tissues of the primary or adjacent sites are recorded in codes 300, 500 or 600. Code 300 when the only information available is “deep tissue involvement.”\n\n**Note 4:** Code 700 (Moderately advanced disease, NOS) only when specific information about moderately advanced disease is not available (see codes 300 and 500).",
