If the differential diagnosis includes non-head and neck sites, for example, the path report states metastasis to the cervical lymph node could be from a head and neck primary, lung primary, or gynecologic primary OR if there is no information indicating origin of primary tumor, then code primary site as C809 (Ill Defined Other)",
