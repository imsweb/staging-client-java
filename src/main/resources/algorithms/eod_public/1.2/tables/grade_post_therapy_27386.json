For all other lymphoma histologies, code 9.\n\n**Note 3:** Assign the highest grade from the resected primary tumor assessed after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n**Note 4:** Follicular lymphoma grade is based on the absolute number of centroblasts per high-power (40 x objective, 0.159 square mm) microscopic field (HPF).\n\n**Note 5:** Codes 1-5 take priority over L.\n\n**Note 6:** Code 9 when \n* Surgical resection is done after neoadjuvant therapy and grade from the primary site is not documented\n* Grade checked “not applicable” on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available",
