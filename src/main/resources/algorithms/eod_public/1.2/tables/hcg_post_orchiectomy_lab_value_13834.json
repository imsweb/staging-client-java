  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n. \n**Note 2:** Record the value of the hCG test as documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** If the initial post-orchiectomy hCG remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest hCG value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again.\n\n**Note 4:** A lab value expressed in International Units/liter (IU/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in milli-International Units/milliliter (mIU/mL).\n\n**Note 5:** If the pre-orchiectomy hCG was normal, a post-orchiectomy hCG may not be performed. In this case, code XXXXX.9 should be recorded.\n\n**Note 6:** If the only information available is a statement of elevated or normal, code XXXXX.9.\n\n**Note 7:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in hCG Post-Orchiectomy Range [NAACCR Data Item #3847].",
