Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** GIST of the corpus, ovary and fallopian tube are collected in the following: \n\n* C540-C549, C559: *Corpus Sarcoma*\n* C569: *Ovary*\n* C570: *Fallopian Tube*\n    \n **Note 3:** For GIST tumors arising in the tubular organs of the digestive system (Esophagus, Stomach, Small Intestine, Appendix, Colon and Rectum), any extension beyond the muscular wall (e.g. invasion beyond the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS) into adjacent tissues, sites or organs is no longer considered confined to the site of origin (code 1). \n* Extension through the wall, NOS, or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS without further extension would be code 1 (confined to the site of origin).\n* Extension through the wall, NOS or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS with any further extension into underlying tissues/fat, organs or structures would be included code 2 or 7 (Adjacent (connective) tissue, NOS or Extension to organs/structures, NOS).\n\n**Note 4:** See the chapter corresponding to the primary site for information about the siteâ€™s anatomy. The corresponding chapter can be used to help determine what the adjacent (connective) tissues, structures or organs are, but the site-specific chapter codes are not to be used to determine whether a GIST tumor is localized, regional or distant.\n\n**Note 5:** For GIST tumors arising in the Retroperitoneum (C480-C482, C488), refer to the Summary Stage General Instructions for the definition of adjacent (connective) tissue. Refer to the General Instructions to determine whether the GIST tumor involves adjacent tissues, or is confined to the primary site. \n\n**Note 6:** Nodal metastasis is very rare in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and surgeons generally agree that nodal dissection is not indicated. In the absence of information on regional lymph node status for a localized tumor, assume nodes are negative.",
