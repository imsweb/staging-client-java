Record the tertiary pattern prior to neoadjuvant treatment. \n* If a tertiary pattern is documented on needle core biopsy or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), it should be disregarded. \n* Do not code the tertiary pattern on prostatectomy or autopsy in Gleason Patterns Pathological.\n\n**Note 4:** The CAP Prostate Protocol does not include Patterns 1 and 2 for Tertiary Pattern.\n\n**Note 5:** If neoadjuvant therapy was given, code Gleason patterns as X9.",
