Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** See the following chapters for the listed histologies \n* 8720-8790: *Melanoma Skin* (C500 only)\n* 8710-8714, 8800-8934, 8940-8981, 8990-9137, 9141-9582: *Soft Tissue*\n* 8935-8936: *GIST*\n* 9140: *Kaposi Sarcoma*\n\n**Note 3:** Changes such as dimpling of the skin, tethering, and nipple retraction are caused by tension on Cooper’s ligament(s), not by actual skin involvement. They do not alter the classification.\n\n**Note 4:** Adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening are clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue; assign code 2 for regional extension.\n\n**Note 5:** “Fixation, NOS” is involvement of pectoralis muscle; assign code 2 for regional extension.\n\n**Note 6:** For a clinical description of inflammation, erythema, edema, peau d’orange, or other terms describing skin changes without a stated diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma, assign code 2 for regional extension.\n\n**Note 7:** Negative nodes with positive ITCs or positive molecular findings less than or equal to 0.2 mm are negative for lymph nodes in Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 8:** If the pathology report indicates that nodes are positive but size of the metastases is not stated, assume the metastases are greater than 0.2 mm and code the lymph nodes as positive in this field.\n\n**Note 9:** Bone marrow micrometastasis, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or disseminated tumor cells and clusters (DTCs) that are less than or equal to 0.2 mm are negative for metastasis in Summary Stage.",
