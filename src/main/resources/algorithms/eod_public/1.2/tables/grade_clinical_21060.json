Assume the denominator is 5 square mm if not specified.\n* Low: 5 or fewer mitoses per 5 square mm (L)\n* High: Over 5 mitoses per 5 square mm (H)\n\n**Note 5:** Code 9 when\n* Grade from primary site is not documented\n* Clinical workup is not done (for example, cancer is an incidental finding during surgery for another condition)\n* Grade checked “not applicable” on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available\n\n**Note 6:** If there is only one grade available and it cannot be determined if it is clinical, pathological, or after neo-adjuvant therapy, assign as a clinical grade and code unknown (9) for pathological grade, and blank for post-therapy grade. \n\n**Note 7:** If you are assigning an AJCC 8th edition stage group\n* Grade is required to assign stage group\n* Codes A-D are treated as an unknown grade when assigning AJCC stage group \n* An unknown grade may result in an unknown stage group",
