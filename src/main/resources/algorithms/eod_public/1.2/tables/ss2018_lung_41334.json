Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** See the following chapters for the listed histologies \n* 8710-8714, 8800-8934, 8940-8971, 8973-8975, 8981-9045, 9054-9137, 9141-9582: *Soft Tissue*\n* 8935-8936: *GIST*\n* 9050-9053: *Pleural Mesothelioma*\n* 9140: *Kaposi Sarcoma*\n\n**Note 3:** “Bronchopneumonia” is not the same thing as “obstructive pneumonitis” and should not be coded as such.\n\n**Note 4:** Atelectasis is the failure of the lung to expand (inflate) completely. This may be caused by a blocked airway, a tumor, general anesthesia, pneumonia or other lung infections, lung disease, or long-term bedrest with shallow breathing. Sometimes called a collapsed lung. \n* For staging purposes, atelectasis must present with an obstructing tumor (code 2)\n\n**Note 5:** Specific information about visceral pleura invasion (PL1 or PL2) or  parietal pleural invasion (PL3) are coded as regional (code 2).  Elastic layer involvement has prognostic significance for lung cancer. \n\n**Note 6:** Separate ipsilateral tumor nodules of the same histopathological type (intrapulmonary metastases) are coded either regional (code 2) for same lobe or distant (code 7) for different ipsilateral lobe or contralateral lung.\n\n**Note 7:** “Vocal cord paralysis,” “superior vena cava syndrome,” and “compression of the trachea or the esophagus” are classified as mediastinal lymph node involvement (code 3) unless there is a statement of involvement by direct extension from the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 8:**  Most pleural and pericardial effusions with lung cancer are due to tumor. In a few patients, however, multiple cytopathological examinations of pleural and/or pericardial fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is nonbloody and is not an exudate. Where these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. \n\n**Note 9:** Occult carcinoma occurs when tumor is proven by the presence of malignant cells or bronchial washings, but there is no other evidence of the tumor. These cases are coded as unknown (code 9).",
