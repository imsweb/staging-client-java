The WHO/ISUP grade is now used. If the Fuhrman grade is documented, code 9.\n\n**Note 5:** Code 9 when\n* Grade from primary site is not documented\n* Clinical workup is not done (for example, cancer is an incidental finding during surgery for another condition)\n* Grade checked “not applicable” on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available\n\n**Note 6:** If there is only one grade available and it cannot be determined if it is clinical, pathological, or after neo-adjuvant therapy, assign as a clinical grade and code unknown (9) for pathological grade, and blank for post-therapy grade.",
