The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/l) is equivalent to the same value expressed in ng/mL.\n\n**Note 4:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Range [NAACCR Data Item #3808].",
