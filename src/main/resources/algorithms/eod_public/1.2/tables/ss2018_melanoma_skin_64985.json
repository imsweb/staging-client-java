Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** For melanoma of sites other than those above \n* C003-C005, C008-C069, C090-C148, C300-C329: See Melanoma Head and Neck\n* C690: See Melanoma Conjunctiva \n* C693, C694: See Melanoma Uvea\n* For all other sites, use the appropriate site-specific schema\n\n**Note 3:** Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes. ITCs are defined as any tumor deposits in lymph nodes less than or equal to 0.2 mm.\n\n**Note 4:** If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathological description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 5:** Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II,  code 2 (Clark level IV).\n\n**Note 6:** Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded as regional nodes (code 3).",
