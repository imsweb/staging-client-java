It is also collected in this field as it may have an independent effect on prognosis.\n\n**Note 3:** Perinephric/sinus fat invasion should be confirmed microscopically and is invasion into fat by tumor cells, with or without desmoplastic reaction, and vascular invasion into perinephric/sinus soft tissue. \n\n**Note 4:** Record invasion beyond capsule as documented in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 5:** Do not use imaging findings to code this data item. \n\n**Note 6:** Code 9 if surgical resection of the primary site is performed and there is no mention of invasion beyond capsule.",
