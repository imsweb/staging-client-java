The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.\n\n**Note 5:** Regional lymph nodes are defined as those in the vicinity of the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 6:** Regional lymph node involvement is rare. If there is no mention of lymph node involvement clinically, assume that lymph nodes are negative.",
