  "notes" : "**Note 1:** For cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 and later, all cases of CLL and SLL will require both the **Lugano classification, which is captured in the AJCC stage group data item, and the five components of the modified Rai staging system, which are captured in Site-Specific Data Items (adenopathy, anemia, lymphocytosis, organomegaly, and thrombocytopenia).**\n\nThe terms B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are considered different clinical presentations of the same disease, with both terms coded 9823.  Traditionally the lymphoma diagnosis was staged with the Ann Arbor staging system and it is now staged with the Lugano classification.  In North America, CLL was staged with the Rai system. \n\n**Note 2:** Thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets (Plt) <100,000/μL. This is part of the Modified Rai Staging System and not included as part of the AJCC Lugano staging.\n* Use the cut points listed in the table regardless of the lab’s reference range\n* For cases that document platelet count in SI (Systeme Internationale) units as any of 10x9/L, 10^9/L, or 10E9/L, the cut point of 100,000 cells/µL is equivalent to (100 cells x 10*9/L), (11 cells x 10^9/L, or (100 cells x 10E9/L\n\n**Note 3:** Record this data item based on a blood test (CBC and differential) performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment). In the absence of the lab test, a physician’s statement can be used. \n\n**Note 4:** If the presence/absence of thrombocytopenia determined by available lab values differs from the physician’s statement of thrombocytopenia, the lab value takes precedence.\n\n**Note 5:** If there is no mention of thrombocytopenia, or the relevant lab tests, code 9.",
