Traditionally the lymphoma diagnosis was staged with the Ann Arbor staging system and it is now staged with the Lugano classification.  In North America, CLL was staged with the Rai system. \n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of presence or absence of organomegaly should be used to code this data item.\n\n**Note 3:** Organomegaly is defined as presence of enlarged liver and/or spleen on physical examination and is part of the staging criteria.\n\n**Note 4:** This data item is determined from physical exam alone. If a physical exam cannot be used to detect organomegaly due to issues related to the patients obesity, a physician statement of organomegaly based on a CT scan can be used.\n\n**Note 5:** If there is no mention of organomegaly (present or absent), code 9.",
