Only lymph nodes with metastases greater than 0.2mm (micrometastases or larger) should be counted as positive.  If the pathology report indicates that nodes are positive but size of the metastases is not stated, assume the metastases are > 0.2mm and code the lymph nodes as positive in this field.\n\n**Note 3:** Record all positive regional lymph nodes in this field.  Record the number of positive ipsilateral regional level I-II axillary nodes separately in the appropriate Site-Specific Factor field.",
