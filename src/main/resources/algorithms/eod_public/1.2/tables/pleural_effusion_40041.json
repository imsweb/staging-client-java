Record the absence or presence of pleural effusion and specifically, if present, whether the pleural effusion is non-malignant, malignant, atypical or NOS.\n\n**Note 3:** If imaging indicates a pleural effusion but pleural fluid cytology is described as negative for malignant cells, assign code 1.\n\n**Note 4:** If pleural fluid cytology is described as suspicious/suspicious for mesothelioma, assign code 2.",
