  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This data item applies only to ICD-O-3 histology codes:  9400/3, 9401/3, 9440/3, 9450/3, 9451/3, 9471/3 and 9478/3. If a histology is not included in this list, assign, code 85.  \n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of histologic subtype can be used to code this data item. \n\n**Note 3:** Only one code is applicable for each tumor. \n* IDH mutation status distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 9400/3, Diffuse astrocytoma and 9401/3, Anaplastic astrocytoma.\n* IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deletion distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 code 9450/3, Oligodendroglioma and 9451/3, Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.\n* IDH-wildtype distinguishes clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 9400/3, Diffuse astrocytoma, 9401/3, Anaplastic astrocytoma and 9440/3, Glioblastoma, Epithelioid glioblastoma and Glioblastoma, NOS (note that the new ICD-O-3 code 9445/3 applies to Glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; information regarding this subtype is not collected using this data item).\n* SHH-activation and TP53-wildtype distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 histology code 9471/3, Medulloblastoma. \n* C19MC alteration status distinguishes a clinically important highly aggressive subtype within ICD-O-3 9478/3, Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes.\n\n***Examples:***\n1.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Diffuse Astrocytoma (9400/3). Additional testing done and IDH-mutant is identified. Code 01.\n2.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Anaplastic astrocytoma (9401/3). No further testing or results unknown. Code 99.\n3.\tMRI of brain tumor, clinical diagnosis: glioblastoma.  No further workup.  Code 99.\n4.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Mixed glioma (9382/3). Code 85.",
