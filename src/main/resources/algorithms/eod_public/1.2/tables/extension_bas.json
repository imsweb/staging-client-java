  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Involvement of the pharyngeal space (code 300) is defined as posterolateral infiltration from the nasopharynx beyond the buccopharyngeal fascia into the triangular space lateral to the pharynx. \n\n**Note 2:** Parapharyngeal involvement denotes posterolateral infiltration of tumor beyond the pharyngobasilar fascia. The pharyngobasilar fascia is the fibrous layer of the pharyngeal wall between the mucosa and the muscular layer, attached superiorly to the basilar part of the occipital bone and diminishing in thickness as it descends.\n\n**Note 3:** The masticator space primarily consists of the muscles of mastication, the medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis muscles. The space also includes the ramus of the mandible and the third division of cranial nerve V as it passes through the foramen ovale into the suprahyoid neck.",
