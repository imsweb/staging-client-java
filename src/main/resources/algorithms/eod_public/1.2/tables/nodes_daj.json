  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** If the pathology report indicates that nodes are positive but size of the metastases is not stated, assume the metastases are greater than 0.2 mm and code the lymph nodes as positive in this field.\n\n**Note 3:** If regional nodes are removed and there is no mention of the level or another specific type, assume these are Level I-II and code appropriately.\n\n**Note 4:** Codes 030, 050, and 070 are for nodes that are pathologically negative. \n* Code 030: Negative nodes pathologically with positive ITCs OR positive ITCs AND positive RT-PCR\n* Code 050: Negative nodes pathologically with positive RT-PCR, negative ITCs\n* Code 070: Negative nodes pathologically, unknown if ITCs or RT-PCR\n\n**Note 5:** Codes 100-200 and 350 only apply to involved axillary level I and II lymph nodes. If internal mammary, infraclavicular (subclavicular, level III axillary, apical), or supraclavicular lymph nodes are involved, codes 100-200 and 350 may not be used.\n\n**Note 6:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Note 7:** **Regional lymph nodes include**\n\n- Axillary (ipsilateral), NOS\n- Level I (low-axilla) (low) (superficial), NOS [adjacent to tail of breast]\n    + Anterior (pectoral)\n    + Intramammary\n    + Lateral (brachial)\n    + Posterior (subscapular)\n- Level II (mid-axilla) (central), NOS\n    + Interpectoral (Rotterâ€™s)\n- Level III (high) (deep), NOS\n    + Apical (subclavian)\n    + Axillary vein\n    + Infraclavicular (subclavicular)\n- Internal mammary (ipsilateral)\n- Supraclavicular (transverse cervical) (ipsilateral)",
