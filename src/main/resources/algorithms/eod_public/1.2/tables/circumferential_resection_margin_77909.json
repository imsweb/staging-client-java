  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of Circumferential or Radial Resection Margin can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor involvement of the circumferential resection margin or radial resection margin appears to be a strong prognostic factor for local or systemic recurrences and survival after surgery.\n\n**Note 3:** The CRM may also be referred to as the circumferential radial margin or mesenteric margin.\n\n**Note 4:** According to the AJCC 8th edition, “the CRM is the distance in millimeters between the deepest point of tumor invasion in the primary cancer and the margin of resection in the retroperitoneum or mesentery.” \n\n**Note 5:** Record in Millimeters (mm) to the nearest tenth the distance between the leading edge of the tumor and the nearest edge of surgically dissected margin as recorded in the pathology report. \n\n* ***Examples*** \nIf the CRM is 2 mm, code 2.0\nIf the CRM is 2.78 mm, code 2.8\n\n**Note 6:** If the margin is involved (positive), code 0.0. If the margin is described as less than 1 mm with no more specific measurement, code 0.0; margins of 0-1 mm are recorded by the pathologist as involved.\n\n**Note 7:** If the value is recorded in Centimeters, multiply by 10 to get the value in Millimeters (mm). \n\n* ***Example:*** CRM recorded as 0.2 cm. Multiply 0.2 x 10 and record 2.0\n\n**Note 8:** Use code XX.9 (CRM not mentioned) if the pathology report describes only distal and proximal margins, or margins, NOS. \n* Only specific statements about the CRM are collected in this data item.\n\n**Note 9:** An exact measurement takes precedence over codes beginning with XX.",
