The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).\n\n**Note 4:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value [NAACCR Data Item #3807].",
