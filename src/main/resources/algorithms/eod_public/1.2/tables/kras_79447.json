When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Studies suggest that KRAS gene mutations are often present in colorectal cancer.\n\n**Note 3:** KRAS analysis is commonly done for patients with metastatic disease.\n\n**Note 4:** If KRAS is positive and there is no mention of the mutated codon, or the mutated codon is not specified, code 4.",
