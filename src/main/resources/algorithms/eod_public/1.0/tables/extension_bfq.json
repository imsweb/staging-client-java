  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris. Melanomas of the iris tend to be small, and those arising from or extending to the ciliary body typically are large.\n\n**Note 2:** Primary ciliary body and choroidal melanomas are classified according to four tumor size categories. The tumor size categories are based on the largest basal and thickness.\n* Basal diameter is collected in data item *Measured Basal Diameter*\n* Thickness is collected in the data item *Measured Thickness*",
