  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  This field and Prostate Pathological Extension, must both be coded, whether or not a prostatectomy was performed.  Information from prostatectomy and autopsy is excluded from this field and coded only in Prostate Pathological Extension.\n\n**Note 2:** Code 100 or 110 with a TURP only.\n\n**Note 3:** Clinically inapparent and apparent tumor. When clinical apparency cannot be determined, code 300.\n* **Clinically inapparent tumors** are not palpable. Physician documentation of a DRE that does not mention a palpable \"tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" can be inferred as inapparent. This would include findings limited to benign prostate enlargement/hypertrophy.\n* **Clinically apparent tumors** are palpable. If a clinician documents a \"tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" by physical examination, this can be inferred as apparent. \"Tumor\", \"mass\", or \"nodule\" on imaging can only be used by the registrar if the managing clinician/urologist uses it.\n* Imaging is not used to determine the clinical extension unless the physician clearly incorporates imaging findings into their evaluation. \n* Do **not** infer inapparent or apparent tumor based on the registrar's interpretation of other terms in the DRE or imaging reports.  \n* Code 300 for localized cancer when it is unknown if the tumor is clinically apparent. This would include cases with elevated PSA and positive needle core biopsy but no documentation regarding tumor apparency (inapparent versus apparent). Another example would be a diagnosis made prior to admission for a prostatectomy with no details provided on the initial clinical findings.\n\n**Note 4:** This field is based on the DRE whether or not the tumor is clinically apparent or inapparent. Do not use biopsy results to code this field UNLESS they prove extraprostatic extension. \n\n**Note 5:** If there is no information from the DRE, or the terminology used is not documented in Note 3, but the physician assigns a clinical extent of disease, the registrar can use that.\n* *Example:*  DRE reveals prostate is “firm.” Physician stages the patient as a cT2a. \nThe T2a can be used since the physician has documented this.\n\n**Note 6:** Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the EOD code.\n\n**Note 7:** \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign a description of frozen pelvis to code 700.\n\n**Note 8:** When an incidental finding of prostate cancer is found during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), code 800 (no evidence of primary tumor) in this field. If there is no documentation regarding a normal prostate evaluation (physical examination or imaging) prior to prostatectomy/autopsy, code 999 (unknown; extension not stated) in this field.",
