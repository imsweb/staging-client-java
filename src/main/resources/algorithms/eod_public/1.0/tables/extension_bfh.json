  "notes" : "**Note 1:** For GIST tumors arising in the tubular organs of the digestive system (Esophagus, Stomach, Small Intestine, Appendix, Colon and Rectum), any extension beyond the muscular wall (e.g. invasion beyond the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS) into adjacent tissues, sites or organs is no longer considered confined to the site of origin (EOD Primary Tumor code 100). \n* Extension through the wall, NOS, or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS without further extension would be EOD Primary Tumor code 100 (confined to the site of origin).\n* Extension through the wall, NOS or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS with any further extension into underlying tissues/fat, organs or structures would be included in EOD Primary Tumor codes 400 or 700 (Adjacent (connective) tissue, NOS or Extension to organs/structures, NOS).\n\n**Note 2:** See the chapter (schema) corresponding to the primary site for information about the siteâ€™s anatomy. The corresponding schema can be used to help determine what the adjacent (connective) tissues, structures or organs are, but the site-specific schema codes are not to be used to determine whether a GIST tumor is localized, regional or distant.\n\n**Note 3:** For GIST tumors arising in the Soft Tissue Retroperitoneum (C480-C482, C488), refer to the EOD General Instructions for the definition of adjacent (connective) tissue. Refer to the General Instructions to determine whether the GIST tumor involves adjacent tissues, or is confined to the primary site.",
