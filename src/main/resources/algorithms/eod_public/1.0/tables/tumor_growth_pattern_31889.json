  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of tumor growth pattern can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** Cholangiocarcinoma may be classified by growth pattern. The tumor growth patterns of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include the mass forming type, the periductal infiltrating type, and a mixed type. The periductal infiltrating type of cholangiocarcinoma demonstrates a diffuse longitudinal growth pattern along the bile duct. Limited analyses suggest that the diffuse periductal infiltrating type is associated with a poor prognosis.\n\n**Note 3:** Record the presence or absence of an infiltrating periductal component. This information may be obtained from radiology, surgery, or pathology reports.",
