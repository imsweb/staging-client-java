Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** See the *Urethra* schema, for transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma of the prostatic urethra (C680).\n\n**Note 3:** Assign code 1 when there is only a TURP.\n\n**Note 4:** Imaging is not used to determine the clinical extension unless the physician clearly incorporates imaging findings into their evaluation. \n\n**Note 5:** If there is no information from the DRE, but the physician assigns a clinical extent of disease, the registrar can use that.\n* *Example:*  DRE reveals prostate is “firm.” Physician stages the patient as a cT2a. \nThe T2a (localized) can be used since the physician has documented this.\n\n**Note 6:** Involvement of prostatic urethra does not alter the Summary Stage code.\n\n**Note 7:** “Frozen pelvis” is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s) (code 7).\n\n**Note 8:**  When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found.",
