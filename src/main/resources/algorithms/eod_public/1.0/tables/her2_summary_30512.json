If any sample is positive, record as positive.\n* ***Exception:*** If HER2 is positive on an in situ specimen and HER2 is negative on all tested invasive specimens, code HER2 as negative (code 0).\n\n**Note 5:** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no HER2 results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.    \n\n**Note 6:** If the patient is HER2 positive and node negative, a multigene test such as Oncotype Dx may be performed, in which case another HER2 test will be performed.  Do not record the results of that test in this field.  \n* Record only the results of the test which made the patient eligible to be given the multigene test.",
