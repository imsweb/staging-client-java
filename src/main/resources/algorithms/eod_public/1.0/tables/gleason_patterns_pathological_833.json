  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of Gleason Patterns Pathological can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** Code the Gleason primary and secondary patterns from prostatectomy or autopsy only in this field. Unlike Grade Group Pathological, do not include patterns from tissues taken prior to prostatectomy.\n\n**Note 3:** Usually prostate cancers are graded using Gleason score or pattern. Gleason grading for prostate primaries is based on a 5-component system (5 histologic patterns). Prostatic cancer generally shows two main histologic patterns. The primary pattern, the pattern occupying greater than 50% of the cancer, is usually indicated by the first number of the Gleason grade, and the secondary pattern is usually indicated by the second number.  These two numbers are added together to create a pattern score.  \n* If there are two numbers, assume that they refer to two patterns (the first number being the primary pattern and the second number the secondary pattern), and sum them to obtain the score.\n* If only one number is given and it is less than or equal to 5, assume that it describes a pattern (since scores of 5 or less would reflect Primary or Secondary Pattern Scores of 1 or 2). Code the number as the primary pattern and code the secondary pattern as Unknown. \n* * For ***example,*** if only one number is given and it is a 3, code “39” for Gleason Patterns and “X9” for Gleason Score.\n* If only one number is given and it is greater than 5, assume that it is a score. \n* * For ***example,*** if only one number is given and it is a 7, code “X6” for Gleason Patterns and “07” for Gleason Score. \n* If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score. \n* * For ***example,*** if the pathology report says Gleason 7/10, code “07’ for Gleason Score and “X6” for Gleason Patterns. \n\n**Note 4:** If neoadjuvant therapy was given, code Gleason pathological patterns as X9.\n\n**Note 5:** Do not infer Gleason Primary and Secondary Pattern from Grade Group (Code X9).\n\n**Note 6:** If a tertiary pattern is documented on prostatectomy or autopsy, code in Gleason Tertiary Pattern [NAACCR Data Item # 3842].\n\n**Note 7:** The pathological score is recorded in Gleason Score Pathological [NAACCR Data Item # 3841].",
