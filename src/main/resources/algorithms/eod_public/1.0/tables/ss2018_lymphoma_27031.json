The *Lugano classification* includes an E suffix for lymphoma with either localized extralymphatic presentations (Stage IE) or by contiguous spread from nodal disease (Stage IIE). A change from the Cotswold modification of the Ann Arbor Staging System, E lesions do not apply to patients with Stage III nodal disease; or any patient with nodal disease above and below the diaphragm with concurrent contiguous extralymphatic involvement (Stage IV), which was previously Stage IIIE.\n\n**Note 4:** Schema includes the preferred terms based on the *2017 WHO Classification of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues*\n\n    9590 Malignant lymphoma, NOS\n    9591 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, NOS\n    9596 B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classic Hodgkin lymphoma\n    9597 Primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma\n    9650 Classical Hodgkin lymphoma\n    9651 Lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma\n    9652 Mixed cellularity classic Hodgkin lymphoma\n    9653 Lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma \n    9659 Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\n    9663 Nodular sclerosis classic Hodgkin lymphoma \n    9673 Mantle cell lymphoma\n    9678 Primary effusion lymphoma \n    9679 Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma\n    9680 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)\n    9687 Burkitt lymphoma\n    9688 T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma\n    9689 Splenic marginal zone lymphoma\n    9690 Follicular lymphoma\n    9691 Follicular lymphoma, grade 2\n    9695 Follicular lymphoma, grade 1\n    9698 Follicular lymphoma, grade 3\n    9699 Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)\n    9702 Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS\n    9705 Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma\n    9708 Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma\n    9709 Primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphomas\n    9712 Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma\n    9714 Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-positive\n    9716 Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma\n    9717 Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma\n    9718 Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma\n    9719 Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type\n    9725 Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma\n    9726 Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma\n    9735 Plasmablastic lymphoma\n    9737 ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma\n    9738 HHV8-positive DLBCL, NOS\n    9823 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma\n    9826 Burkitt cell leukemia\n    9827 Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma",
