Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used ONLY when there is no evidence of primary tumor.\n\n**Note 3:**  In cases where ER is reported on more than one breast tumor specimen, record the highest value.  If any sample is positive, record as positive.\n* ***Exception:*** If ER is positive on an in situ specimen and ER is negative on all tested invasive specimens, code ER as negative (code 0).\n\n**Note 4:** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.  If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no ER results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.\n\n**Note 5:** If the patient is ER positive and node negative, a multigene test such as Oncotype Dx may be performed, in which case another ER test will be performed.  Do not record the results of that test in this field.\n* Record only the results of the test which made the patient eligible to be given the multigene test.",
