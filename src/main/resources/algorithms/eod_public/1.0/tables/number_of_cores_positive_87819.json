If positive cores are identified and the number of  positive cores  not specifically documented, code X6. \n\n**Note 3:** If the pathology report contains a summary of the number of cores positive and examined, use the summary provided. If Summary Report is not available and multiple biopsy cores are obtained on the same day, the number of cores examined should be added.\n\n**Note 4:** Transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy (TTSB) is a stereotactic prostate biopsy technique that typically produces 30 to 80 core biopsies. This is an alternative biopsy technique used for some high-risk patients including men with persistently elevated PSA, those who have atypia on prior prostate biopsies, or men with biopsies showing high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).\n\n**Note 5:** The number of cores examined are recorded in Number of Cores Examined [NAACCR Data Item # 3897].",
