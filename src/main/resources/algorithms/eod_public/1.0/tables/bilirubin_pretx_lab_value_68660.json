The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** Assay of Bilirubin Pretreatment Total Lab Value includes conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Record the total bilirubin value for this data item.\n\n**Note 4:** Record to the nearest tenth of mg/dL or umol/L the highest total bilirubin value prior to treatment. \n\n**Note 5:** The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a numerical scale used to determine how urgently a patient with liver disease needs a liver transplant. Results from three routine lab tests are used to calculate the MELD score. Bilirubin, one of the tests, measures how effectively the liver excretes bile.\n\n**Note 6:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in Bilirubin Pretreatment Unit of Measure [NAACCR Data Item # 3814].",
