  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Post-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** Record the range of the AFP test as documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** If the initial post-orchiectomy AFP remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest AFP value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again.\n\n**Note 4:** A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).\n\n**Note 5:** If the pre-orchiectomy AFP was normal, a post-orchiectomy AFP may not be performed. In this case, code 9 should be recorded.\n\n**Note 6:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in AFP Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value [NAACCR Data Item #3805].",
