The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** CEA is a tumor marker that has value in the management of certain malignancies.\n\n**Note 4:** Record to the nearest tenth in nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) the highest CEA lab value documented in the medical record **prior to treatment or polypectomy.** \n* ***Example:*** Code a pretreatment CEA of 7 ng/ml as 7.0. \n\n**Note 5:** For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value. \n* ***Example:*** Code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 ng/ml\" as 0.5.\n\n**Note 6:** Record 0.1 when the lab results are stated as less than 0.1 ng/ml with no exact value.\n\n**Note 7:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in CEA Pretreatment Interpretation [NAACCR Data Item #3819].",
