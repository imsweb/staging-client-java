  "notes" : "**Note 1:** If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathological description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 2:** Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II, code 300 (Clark level IV).\n\n**Note 3:** Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in EOD Regional Nodes.\n\n**Note 4:** In addition to EOD Primary Tumor, the following data items are also collected to determine the extent of the primary tumor:  *Breslowâ€™s Thickness* and *Ulceration*",
