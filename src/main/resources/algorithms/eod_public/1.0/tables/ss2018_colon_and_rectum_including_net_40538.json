However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be coded to localized (code 1) or regional (code 2).\n\n**Note 5:** Tumors characterized by involvement of the serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) by direct extension or perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal surface through inflammation are coded to regional (code 2).",
