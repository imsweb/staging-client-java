  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This schema discriminator is used to discriminate between head and neck tumors with unknown primary site coded as C760.  Some situations require that a more specific primary site be assigned.\n\t\n* **Chapter 6: Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck**\n \n     Occult head and neck tumor with cervical metastasis in level II/III lymph nodes without a p16 immunostain or with negative results and without an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ hybridization performed or with negative results are staged using Chapter 6\n* **Chapter 9: Nasopharynx**\n \n     Occult head and neck tumors with cervical metastasis in level II/III lymph nodes that is positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV+) encoded small RNAs (EBER) identified by in situ hybridization are staged using Chapter 9. Assign primary site C119; do NOT code this discriminator\n* **Chapter 10: HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer**\n \n     Occult head and neck tumors with cervical metastasis in level II/III lymph nodes, p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC), should be staged using Chapter 10. Assign primary site C109; do NOT code this discriminator\n* **Ill Defined, Other (Summary Stage only)**\n\n    If the tumor is not occult or does not have cervical metastasis in level II/III lymph nodes, it is not included in Chapter 6 and will be classified as Ill Defined, Other for Summary Staging\n\n**Note 2:** Assign this data item based on physician statement or from lab tests performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment).\n\n**Note 3:** If the code determined by available lab tests differs from the physician statement, the physician’s statement takes precedence.",
