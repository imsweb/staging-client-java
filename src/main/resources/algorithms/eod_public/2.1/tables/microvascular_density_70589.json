The number of immunopositive elements is labeled with a marker for vascular endothelial cells (e.g., CD34 epitope, CD31 epitope, factor VIII-related antigen) and counted from area of densest vascularization (typical field area, 0.3 mm2 squared). Higher counts are associated with shorter survival. \n\n**Note 3:** Record the results as expressed on the laboratory test. Record the information based on quartiles for laboratory standards if this is the only expression of results.",
