  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the Multigene Signature Method can be used to code this data item.\n\n**Note 2:** Multigene signatures or classifiers are assays of a panel of genes from a tumor specimen, intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of response to chemotherapy and to evaluate prognosis or the likelihood of future metastasis.  \n* Only record tests done on tumor tissue that help determine if the cancer is likely to recur.  Don’t include other tests, such as those that evaluate hereditary mutations that influence a patient’s risk of developing cancer (e.g. myRisk, BRCA)\n\n**Note 3:** Code the type of test performed. The same test should be used to record information in Multigene Signature Results [NAACCR Data Item #3895].\n\n**Note 4:** Oncotype Dx tests are not recorded in this data item. See the following data items for Oncotype Dx.\n* Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS [NAACCR Data Item #3903]\n* Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-Invasive [NAACCR Data Item #3904]\n* Oncotype Dx Risk Level-DCIS [NAACCR Data Item #3905]\n* Oncotype Dx Risk Level-Invasive [NAACCR Data Item #3906]",
