SS2018 stages these as localized (behavior code 3)\n* Intramucosal, NOS\n* Lamina propria\n* Mucosa, NOS\n* Confined to, but not through muscularis mucosa\n\n**Note 5:** Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 6:** Invasion into \"pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue\" can be either Localized or Regional, depending on the primary site. Some sites are entirely peritonealized; some sites are only partially peritonealized or have no peritoneum. Localized may not be used for sites that are entirely peritonealized (cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid colon, upper third of rectum).\n+ Localized\n   - Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n   - Non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues invaded [Ascending Colon/Descending Colon/Hepatic Flexure/Splenic Flexure/Upper two thirds of rectum: Posterior surface; Lower third of rectum]\n   - Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n+ Regional\n   - Mesentery\n   - Peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues invaded [Ascending Colon/Descending Colon/Hepatic Flexure/Splenic Flexure/Upper third of rectum: anterior and lateral surfaces; Cecum; Sigmoid Colon; Transverse Colon; Rectosigmoid; Rectum: middle third anterior surface]\n    - Pericolic/Perirectal fat\n+ If the pathologist does not further describe the “pericolic/perirectal tissues” as either “non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” vs “peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” fat and the gross description does not describe the tumor relation to the serosa/peritoneal surface, and it cannot be determined whether the tumor arises in a peritonealized portion of the colon, code Localized.\n\n**Note 7:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is coded as regional (code 2) or distant (code 7). However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be coded to localized (code 1) or regional (code 2).\n\n**Note 8:** Tumors characterized by involvement of the serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) by direct extension or perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal surface through inflammation are coded to regional (code 2).",
