  "description" : "S Category Clinical combines the results of pre-orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP), Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) into a summary S value.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code the S category as described by the physician. If the S category determined by available lab values or calculated by vendor software differs from the physician statement of the S category, the physician's statement takes precedence. \n\n**Note 2:** Code the pre-orchiectomy S category according to the table below. This table is also available in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 59, Testis.\n* For AFP, a lab value expressed in micrograms per liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml).\n\n**Note 3:** Clinical stage values are those based on physician statement or lab values at diagnosis, prior to orchiectomy, and prior to any systemic treatment.\n\n**Note 4:** All three lab values are needed for S0-S1. Only one elevated test is needed to assign S2-3. If any individual test is not available and none of the available tests results meets the S2-3 criterion for that test, assign code 9 (SX).",
