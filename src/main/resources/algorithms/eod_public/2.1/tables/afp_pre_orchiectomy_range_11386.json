  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Pre-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** Record the range of the highest AFP test result documented in the medical record **prior to orchiectomy** or prior to any systemic treatment. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).\n\n**Note 4:** If the lab value is expressed in IU/ml, use the following conversion: 1 ng/mL = 0.83 IU/mL.\n* To calculate ng from IU/mL, divide the value for IU by 0.83.\n* *Example*: 10 IU/mL: 10/0.83 = 12.04 ng/mL; 5 IU/mL: 5/0.83= 6.02 ng/mL\n\n**Note 5:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value [NAACCR Data Item #3807].",
