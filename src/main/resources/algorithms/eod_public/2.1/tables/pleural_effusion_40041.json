Record the absence or presence of pleural effusion and specifically, if present, whether the pleural effusion is non-malignant, malignant, atypical or NOS.\n\n**Note 2:** A physicianâ€™s statement of positive (malignant) pleural effusion or a positive cytology confirming a malignant pleural effusion must be used to code this data item.\n* Code 2 when \n   * There is a positive malignant pleural effusion confirmed by cytology \n   * Pleural fluid cytology is described as suspicious/suspicious for mesothelioma \n* Code 3 when cytology is described as atypical/atypical mesothelial cells\n\n**Note 3:** The presence of a pleural effusion on imaging alone (i.e., a pleural effusion, NOS) is not equivalent to a malignant pleural effusion.\n* Code 1 if imaging indicates a pleural effusion but pleural cytology is described as negative for malignant cells\n* Code 4 if imaging indicates a pleural effusion and there is no further information on whether it is positive or negative or cytology not done",
