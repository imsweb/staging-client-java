  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and lymph node detail are available, record the code with lymph node detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 3:** Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction). Lymph nodes with ITCs only are not counted as positive nodes. \n* For positive ITCs with NO regional lymph node involvement, code 050\n\n**Note 4:** Regional lymph nodes include\n- Femoral\n- Inguinal, NOS\n  + Inguinofemoral (groin)\n  + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n  + Superficial inguinal\n\n**Note 5:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
