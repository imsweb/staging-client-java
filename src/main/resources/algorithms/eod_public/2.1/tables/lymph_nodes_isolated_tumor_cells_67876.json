  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of Isolated Tumor Cells (ITCs) can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** ITCs include single tumor cells or small clusters, less than or equal to 0.2 mm in greatest dimension, generally without stromal response in the lymph node. These cells usually are found in the subcapsular nodal sinuses but may be seen within the nodal parenchyma.\n\n**Note 3:** ITCs may be identified in lymph nodes by hematoxylin and eosin staining or by specialized pathological techniques, such as IHC for cytokeratin proteins for carcinomas. Specialized pathology techniques such IHC and molecular techniques are not recommended for routine examination of lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 4:** Record the status of ITCs as documented by the pathologist.",
