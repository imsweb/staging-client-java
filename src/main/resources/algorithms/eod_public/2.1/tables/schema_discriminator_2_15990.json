  "notes" : "**Note 1:** A schema discriminator is used to discriminate for peripheral nerve tumors (C473, C475) and connective tissue tumors (C493, C494, C495) for the subsite in which the tumor arose. \n\n**Note 2:** Code 1 is used for external structures and is assigned to AJCC 8th edition Chapter 41: Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Trunk and Extremities (Schema ID 00410: Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Trunk and Extremities). \n* *Example:* Trapezius muscle (C493) is an external structure, on the outer layer or periphery of the body\n\n**Note 3:** Code 2 is used for internal structures and is assigned to AJCC 8th edition Chapter 42: Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Abdomen and Thoracic Visceral Organs (Schema ID 00421: Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Abdomen and Thoracic Visceral Organs).\n* *Example:* Aorta (C493) is an internal structure, in the inner parts of the body\n\n**Note 4:** Code 8 is only used for cases for 2018-2020 that have already been abstracted prior to the Version 2.0 update (2021 update). It can also be used for 2018-2020 cases that are abstracted after the 2021 updates. \n* For cases diagnosed 2021+, code 8 cannot be used\n\n**Note 5:** Code 9 is used for when there is not enough specific information to determine if the structure is external or internal and is assigned to AJCC 8 edition Chapter 45: Soft Tissue Sarcoma of Unusual Sites and Histologies (Schema ID 00450: Soft Tissue Other).\n* *Example:* Chest NOS (C493) does not provide enough information in order to determine if it is either an external structure, on the outer layer or periphery of the body, or an internal structure, in the inner parts of the body",
