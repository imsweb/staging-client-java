  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Take the highest Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage documented in the medical record. Do not attempt to code FIGO stage based only on T, N, and M.  If FIGO stage is not documented in the medical record, code 99. FIGO stage is not the same as FIGO grade. Only code FIGO stage in this field, do not code FIGO grade. \n\n**Note 2:** If a stage group is stated but it does not specify that it is a FIGO stage, assume that it is a FIGO stage and code it.\n\n**Note 3:** If there is more than one FIGO stage provided from the clinical and pathological work up, code the most extensive FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 4:** The FIGO stage definitions do not include Stage 0 (Tis). Code 97 for any case that is in situ (/2).\n\n**Note 5:** For Endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) (8380/2) and Serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (SEIC) (8441/2), assign the FIGO stage based on the physician's documentation of FIGO I.\n* Do not code 97 (in situ) for Endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) and Serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (SEIC) since FIGO does not have a Stage 0\n* If diagnosis is Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) (8380/2), code 97",
