Some situations require that a more specific primary site be assigned.\n\t\n* **AJCC 8th edition Chapter 6: Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck (Schema ID 00060: Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary)**\n \n     Occult head and neck tumor with cervical metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes without a p16 immunostain or with negative results and without an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ hybridization performed or with negative results are staged using Chapter 6. **Assign primary site C760; code the schema discriminator accordingly.**\n* **AJCC 8th edition Chapter 9: Nasopharynx (Schema ID 00090: Nasopharynx)**\n \n     Occult head and neck tumors with cervical metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes that is positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV+) (regardless of p16 status) encoded small RNAs (EBER) identified by in situ hybridization are staged using Chapter 9. **Assign primary site C119; do NOT code this discriminator.**\n* **AJCC 8th edition Chapter 10: HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer**\n \n    Occult head and neck tumors with cervical metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes, p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC), should be staged using Chapter 10. **Assign primary site C109; do NOT code this discriminator**\n* **Ill-Defined Other (Summary Stage only) (Schema ID 99999: Ill-Defined Other)**\n\n   If the tumor is not occult or does not have cervical metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes, it is not included in Chapter 6 and will be classified as Ill-Defined Other for Summary Staging\n\n**Note 2:** If there is no evidence of the primary tumor, yet the physician \"suspects\" a specific head and neck subsite, do not assign that primary site, but code C760 (see exceptions for EBV positive or p16 positive cancers.)",
