  "notes" : "**Note 1:** For head and neck schemas, this field includes all lymph nodes defined as Levels I-VII and Other by TNM. \n\n**Note 2:** For this schema, code 000 (no regional lymph node involvement) is not applicable. This code was removed effective Version 2.0 and later in an effort to stop this schema being used when it is not applicable. To get into this schema, there **must** be lymph node involvement (clinically or pathologically)\n- If you are in this schema and there are negative nodes clinically, please review the response to Schema Discriminator 1: Occult Head and Neck Lymph Nodes and reassign appropriately (Code 1is for primary site C760 with negative lymph node involvement)\n- This schema may be used for nodes that are clinically positive (FNA, core biopsy, lymph node biopsy, lymph node excision or sentinel lymph node biopsy), but are confirmed to be pathologically negative on a lymph node dissection. In these cases, the clinical lymph node involvement has priority and should be coded in this field\n  * ***Example 1:*** Excision of a single cervical node was positive, subsequent cervical lymph node dissection was negative\n  * ***Example 2:*** Biopsy of a cervical was positive, the patient underwent neoadjuvant treatment, followed by a negative lymph node dissection\n- This schema may **not** be used when nodes are positive on imaging only (not microscopically confirmed clinically) and the same nodes are removed and negative. In this situation, the pathological lymph node involvement would take priority and the lymph nodes would be coded as not involved (see first bullet about reviewing the schema discriminator)\n\n**Note 3:** This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n+ **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (450) are used when there is a clinical work up. This includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, or lymph node excision\n  - *Exception:* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment code would take priority\n+ **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (150, 500, 600, 700) are used for this schema when \n   - FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up and\n   - Lymph node dissection performed\n       \n+ Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological\n\n\n**Note 4:** If laterality of lymph nodes is not specified, assume nodes are ipsilateral.  Midline nodes are ipsilateral.\n\n**Note 5:** Supraclavicular lymph nodes can be either Level IV or Level V\n* Level IV: deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in the lower jugular chain\n* Level V: in the posterior triangle, inferior to the transverse cervical artery, supraclavicular lymph nodes, NOS\n\n**Note 6:** For codes 100-700, use the list below for named regional lymph nodes. If the only information available is \"regional lymph nodes, NOS\" or \"lymph nodes,\" code 800.\n\n**The following lymph nodes are regional for Head and Neck tumors**\n\n**Level I**\nLevel IA - Submental\nLevel IB - Submandibular (submaxillary), sublingual\n\n**Level II - Upper jugular** \nJugulodigastric (subdigastric)\nUpper deep cervical        \nLevel IIA - Anterior\nLevel IIB - Posterior    \n\n**Level III - Middle jugular**\nMiddle deep cervical\n\n**Level IV - Lower jugular**\nJugulo-omohyoid (supraomohyoid)\nLower deep cervical        \nVirchow node\n\n**Level V - Posterior triangle group**\nPosterior cervical\nLevel VA - Spinal accessory        \nLevel VB - Transverse cervical, supraclavicular \n\n**Level VI - Anterior compartment group**\nLaterotracheal\nParalaryngeal\nParatracheal - above suprasternal notch\nPerithyroidal\nPrecricoid (Delphian)\nPrelaryngeal\nPretracheal - above suprasternal notch\nRecurrent laryngeal\n\n**Level VII - Superior mediastinal group (for other mediastinal node(s) see EOD Mets)**\nEsophageal groove\nParatracheal - below suprasternal notch\nPretracheal - below suprasternal notch    \n\n**Other groups**\nCervical, NOS\nDeep cervical, NOS\nFacial\n- Buccinator (buccal)\n- Mandibular\n- Nasolabial\n\nInternal jugular, NOS\nParapharyngeal \nParotid\n- Infraauricular\n- Intraparotid\n- Periparotid\n- Preauricular\n\nRetroauricular (mastoid)\nRetropharyngeal\nSuboccipital\n\n**Note 7:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
