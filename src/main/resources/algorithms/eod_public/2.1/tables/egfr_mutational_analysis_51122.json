If information is not available, code 9. \n\n**Note 4:** The most common EGFR mutations are \n * Exon 18 Gly719\n * Exon 19 deletion\n * Exon 20 insertion\n * Exon 20 Thr790Met\n * Exon 21 Leu858Arg\n\n**Note 5:** If EGFR is positive and there is no mention of the mutated codon, or the mutated codon is not specified, code 4.\n\n**Note 6:** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n * If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no EGFR results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens\n\n**Note 7:** Code 9 when\n * Insufficient amount of tissue available to perform test\n * No microscopic confirmation of tumor \n * EGFR not ordered or not done, or unknown if ordered or done",
