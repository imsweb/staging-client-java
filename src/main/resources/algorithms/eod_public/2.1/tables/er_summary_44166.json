If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no ER results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.\n\n**Note 8:** If the patient is ER positive and node negative, a multigene test such as Oncotype Dx may be performed, in which case another ER test will be performed.  Do not record the results of that test in this field.\n* Record only the results of the test which made the patient eligible to be given the multigene test",
