Other names include: extranodal spread, extracapsular extension, or extracapsular spread.\"  \n* \"A regional node extending into a distant structure or organ is categorized as ENE and is not recorded as distant metastatic disease.\" \n\n**Note 3:** Be aware that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.\n\n**Note 4:** Code the status of extranodal extension assessed on the **surgical resection** specimen for the most involved regional lymph node(s). Do not code ENE for any distant nodes.\n* If codes 0, 1, or 7 are used, this indicates that the lymph nodes were surgically resected and Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery [NAACCR Data Item: 1292] must be 3-7",
