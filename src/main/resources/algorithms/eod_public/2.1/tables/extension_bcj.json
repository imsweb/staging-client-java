  "notes" : "**Note 1:** In the United States and Canada, Kaposi sarcoma is usually an illness related to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which affects primarily the skin; however, lesions may also form in the connective tissue, mucosa (e.g. oral cavity) or visceral organs (e.g. lungs).  For connective tissue tumors (C49._), use extension codes for skin.\n\n**Note 2:** Choice of EOD Primary Tumor for Kaposi Sarcoma depends on the number and location of lesions\n* Code 100 (Localized) is for a single lesion involving one of the following:  skin, mucosa or viscera\n* Code 200 (Localized) is for multiple lesions involving one of the following:  skin, mucosa or viscera\n* Code 300 (Regional) is for multiple lesions involving a combination of skin, mucosa or viscera",
