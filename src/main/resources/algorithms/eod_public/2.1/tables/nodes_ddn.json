  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n+ **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 200, 600, 650) are used when there is a clinical work up only and there is no surgical resection of the primary tumor or site. This includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, or lymph node excision\n   - *Exception:* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment code would take priority\n+ **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (300, 350, 400, 500, 700, 750) are used when\n   - Primary tumor or site surgically resected with\n     - Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes. Includes\n       - FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up and/or\n       - Lymph node dissection performed\n + Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological information\n\n**Note 3:** Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction).\n* Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 4:** In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph node(s) or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis with positive lymph node(s) are coded under regional lymph nodes.\n* Code 600 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 650 if there are **clinically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 700 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITHOUT regional lymph node involvement\n* Code 750 if there are **pathologically** in-transit metastasis WITH regional lymph node involvement\n\n**Note 5:** Regional lymph nodes for skin\n* Single, Multiple, Ipsilateral, Bilateral or Contralateral lymph nodes\n\n**Skin of head and neck (C000-C006, C008-C009, C440-C444)**\n- Levels I-VII \n- Axillary (neck only, C444)\n- Cervical, NOS\n- Deep cervical, NOS\n- Facial (buccinator, buccal, nasolabial)\n- Internal jugular, NOS\n- Parapharyngeal \n- Parotid (infraauricular, intraparotid, periparotid, preauricular)\n- Retroauricular (mastoid)\n- Retropharyngeal\n- Suboccipital\n\n**Skin of trunk (C445)**\n- Upper trunk \n  + Axillary\n  + Cervical\n  + Internal mammary\n  + Supraclavicular\n- Lower trunk \n  + Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Skin of upper limb and shoulder (C446)**\n- Axillary\n- Cervical\n- Epitrochlear for hand/forearm\n- Internal mammary (parasternal)\n- Spinal accessory for shoulder\n- Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n\n**Skin of lower limb and hip (C447)**\n- Femoral (superficial inguinal)\n- Inguinal\n- Popliteal for heel and calf\n\n**Vulva (C510-C512, C518-C519)**\n- Deep inguinal, NOS\n- Femoral\n- Inguinal, NOS\n- Inguinofemoral (groin)\n- Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n- Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Penis (C600-C602, C608-C609)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Scrotum (C632)**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric), NOS\n        * Obturator\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Deep inguinal, NOS\n        * Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n**Note 6:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
