  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code 000 (behavior code 2) includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial), or described as in situ. \n\n**Note 2:** Code 050 (behavior code 3) includes the following:\n* Intramucosal, NOS\n* Lamina propria\n* Mucosa, NOS\n* Confined to, but not through the muscularis mucosa\n\n**Note 3:** Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is coded as 600 or 700. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be coded to 100-500.\n\n**Note 5:** Invasion into \"pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue\" can be either codes 300 or 400, depending on the primary site. Some sites are entirely peritonealized; some sites are only partially peritonealized or have no peritoneum. Code 300 may not be used for sites that are entirely peritonealized (cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid colon, upper third of rectum). \n+ Code 300 \n   - Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n   - Non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues invaded [Ascending Colon/Descending Colon/Hepatic Flexure/Splenic Flexure/Upper two thirds of rectum: Posterior surface; Lower third of rectum]\n    - Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n+ Code 400 \n   - Mesentery\n   - Peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues invaded [Ascending Colon/Descending Colon/Hepatic Flexure/Splenic Flexure/Upper third of rectum: anterior and lateral surfaces; Cecum; Sigmoid Colon; Transverse Colon; Rectosigmoid; Rectum: middle third anterior surface]\n    - Pericolic/Perirectal fat\n+ If the pathologist does not further describe the “pericolic/perirectal tissues” as either “non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” vs “peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” and the gross description does not describe the tumor relation to the serosa/peritoneal surface, and it cannot be determined whether the tumor arises in a peritonealized portion of the colon, code 300.\n\n**Note 6:** Tumors characterized by involvement of the serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) by direct extension or perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal surface through inflammation are coded to 500.",
