This information is then combined to score the sample on a scale from 0 to 8. The higher the score, the more receptors were found and the easier they were to see in the sample.\n* The registrar should not calculate the Allred Score unless both components are available (proportion score and intensity)\n* See the ***Allred Score for Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor Evaluation*** section in the SSDI manual for assistance in determining the Allred Score\n\n**Note 4:** If ER test is performed, but Allred score is not documented, or cannot be calculated, code X9.",
