  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the Multigene Signature Results can be used to code this data item.\n\n**Note 2:**  Multigene signatures or classifiers are assays of a panel of genes from a tumor specimen, intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of response to chemotherapy and to evaluate prognosis or the likelihood of future metastasis. \n* Only record tests done on tumor tissue that help determine if the cancer is likely to recur.  Don’t include other tests, such as those that evaluate hereditary mutations that influence a patient’s risk of developing cancer (e.g. myRisk, BRCA)\n\n**Note 3:** Code the score or risk for the test performed. The same test should be used to record information in Multigene Signature Method [NAACCR Data Item #3894].\n\n**Note 4:** Oncotype Dx tests are not recorded in this data item. See the following data items for Oncotype Dx.\n* Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS [NAACCR Data Item #3903]\n* Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-Invasive [NAACCR Data Item #3904]\n* Oncotype Dx Risk Level-DCIS [NAACCR Data Item #3905]\n* Oncotype Dx Risk Level-Invasive [NAACCR Data Item #3906]\n\n**Note 5:** PAM50 (Prosigna) is a single numeric score of 0-100. If the score is available, record the score. If only the risk level is available, record that.\n\n**Note 6:** For Mammaprint, EndoPredict, and Breast Cancer Index, only record the risk level.",
