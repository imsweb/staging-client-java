A high value indicates a tumor that is proliferating more rapidly.  \n\n**Note 3:** Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used, **ONLY** when there is no evidence of primary tumor. \n\n**Note 4:** Ki-67 results are reported as the percentage cell nuclei that stain positive.  As of early 2017 there are no established standards for interpretation of results or for cutoffs for positive and negative.  \n\n* ***Examples:***\n    Ki-67 reported as 14%. Code 14.0\n    Ki-67 reported as 8.6%. Code 8.6",
