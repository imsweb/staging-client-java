Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** For melanoma of sites other than those above \n* C003-C005, C008-C069, C090-C148, C300-C329: See Melanoma Head and Neck\n* C690: See Melanoma Conjunctiva \n* C693, C694: See Melanoma Uvea\n* For all other sites, use the appropriate site-specific schema\n\n**Note 3:** If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathological description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 4:** Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II,  code 2 (Clark level IV).\n\n**Note 5:** If a Breslow’s depth is given in the pathology report and there is no other indication of involvement, the following guidelines may be used (***Note:** If a physician documents a different Clark's Level then provided by these guidelines, go with the physician's Clark Level*)\n+ In situ: Level 1\n+ Localized\n   - Level II (< 0.75 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n   - Level III (0.76 mm to 1.50 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n   - Level IV (> 1.50 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n+ Regional\n   - Level V: Through entire dermis\n\n**Note 6:** Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods. ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction).\n* Lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are counted as positive lymph nodes\n\n**Note 7:** In-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis are metastasis that have occurred via lymphatic or angiolymphatic spread. Satellite nodules are subcutaneous metastasis that occur within 2 cm of the primary tumor. Microsatellite metastasis are microscopic cutaneous metastasis found adjacent or deep to a primary melanoma tumor.\n* In-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastasis are counted as positive nodes\n\n**Note 8:** Bilateral or contralateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy. Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.\n* Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 9:** Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins and are coded as regional nodes.",
