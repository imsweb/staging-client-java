  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Intrahepatic vascular invasion is used synonymously with vascular invasion for tumors in codes 100-500 and includes gross and microscopic involvement (microvascular invasion) of vessels. \n\n**Note 2:** Multiple tumors include satellitosis, multifocal tumors, and intrahepatic metastasis.\n\n**Note 3:** The liver is divided into several lobes as defined below. If multiple lobes (such as the Caudate lobe and the Left Lobe) are involved, see codes 300-500. If multiple segments (such as 5 and 6 in the right lobe) in the same lobe are involved, this would be multiple tumors within one lobe (code 200)\n* Caudate lobe: Segment 1\n* Quadrate lobe: Segment 4b\n* Left lobe: Segments 2, 3, 4a\n* Right lobe: Segments 5, 6, 7, 8",
