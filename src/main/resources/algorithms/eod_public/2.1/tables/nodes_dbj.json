  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n+ **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 200, 300) are used when there is a clinical work up only and there is no surgical resection of the primary tumor or site. This includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, or lymph node excision\n  - *Exception:* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment code would take priority\n+ **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (400, 500) are used when \n   - Primary tumor or site surgically resected with\n     - Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes. Includes\n       - FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up and/or\n       - Lymph node dissection performed\n\n+ Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological information\n\n**Note 3:** Regional lymph nodes include\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Note 4:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
