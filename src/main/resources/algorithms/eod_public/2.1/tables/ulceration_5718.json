Do not use findings from physical exam. \n* It is possible for a patient to present with an ulcerated lesion noted on physical exam, but this is not the same thing as ulceration seen on a microscopic exam\n\n**Note 3:** Melanoma ulceration is the absence of an intact epidermis overlying the primary melanoma based upon microscopic (histopathological) examination.\n\n* Code 1 if any biopsy (punch, shave, excisional, etc.) or wide excision is positive for ulceration in the presence of an underlying melanoma\n* Code 0 if all specimens are negative OR one specimen is negative and the other is unknown\n* Ulceration must be caused by an underlying melanoma. Ulceration caused by trauma from a previous procedure should not be coded as positive for this SSDI \n\n**Note 4:** Code 9 if there is microscopic examination and there is no mention of ulceration.\n* This instruction **does** apply to in situ tumors",
