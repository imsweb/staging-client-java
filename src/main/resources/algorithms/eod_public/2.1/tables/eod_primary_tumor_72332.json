  "notes" : "**Note:** The cortex of a bone is the dense outer shell that provides strength to the bone; the spongy center of a bone is the cancellous portion.  The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.",
