Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** Bilateral or contralateral nodes are classified as regional nodes for truncal tumors (C445) with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy. Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.\n* Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed\n\n**Note 3:** Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins and are coded as regional nodes.\n\n**Note 4:** Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
