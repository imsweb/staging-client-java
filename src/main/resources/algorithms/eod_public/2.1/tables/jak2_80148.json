Testing for the JAK2 mutation is done on whole blood. Nearly all people with polycythemia vera, and about half of those with primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia, have the mutation.\n\n**Note 3:** Record JAK2 for any hematopoietic neoplasm. It is most commonly used for the following histologies: \n* Polycythemia Vera (9950/3)\n* Primary myelofibrosis (9961/3)\n* Essential Thrombocytopenia (9962/3)\n* Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (9945/3)",
