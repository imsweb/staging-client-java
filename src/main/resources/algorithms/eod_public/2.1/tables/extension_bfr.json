  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris. Melanomas of the iris tend to be small, and those arising from or extending to the ciliary body typically are large.\n\n**Note 2:** Discrete tumor deposit(s) in the orbit that are not contiguous to the eye are recorded in lymph nodes (See EOD Regional Nodes).",
