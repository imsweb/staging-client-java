If a physician incorporates imaging findings into their evaluation (including the clinical T category), do not use this information.\n\n**Note 6:** If there is no information from the DRE, but the physician assigns a clinical extent of disease, the registrar can use that.\n* *Example:*  DRE reveals prostate is \"firm.\" Physician stages the patient as a cT2a. \nThe T2a (localized) can be used since the physician has documented this.\n\n**Note 7:** Involvement of prostatic urethra does not alter the Summary Stage code.\n\n**Note 8:** \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s) (code 7).\n\n**Note 9:**  When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found.",
