  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Melanoma in situ is also called primary acquired melanosis.\n\n**Note 2:** The EOD Primary Tumor collapses the clinical and pathological information. Pathological evidence takes priority over clinical evidence, unless the clinical evidence was clearly greater or the patient had neoadjuvant treatment. \n\n**Note 3:** Nodular or well-defined conjunctival melanomas are clinically categorized according to the regional location of their posterior and anterior margins (i.e., cornea, limbus, bulbar conjunctiva, fornix, palpebral conjunctiva, plica, caruncle, or eyelid skin) and by their circumferential extent, in clock minutes, in each of these regions. A “quadrant” comprises 15 clock minutes regardless of the meridian locations of the lateral margins.",
