  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Changes such as dimpling of the skin, tethering, and nipple retraction are caused by tension on Cooper’s ligament(s), not by actual skin involvement. They do not alter the classification.\n\n**Note 2:** Adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening are clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue; assign code 200.\n\n**Note 3:** “Fixation, NOS” is involvement of pectoralis muscle; assign code 200.\n\n**Note 4:** For a clinical description of inflammation, erythema, edema, peau d’orange, or other terms describing skin changes without a stated diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma, assign code 400.",
