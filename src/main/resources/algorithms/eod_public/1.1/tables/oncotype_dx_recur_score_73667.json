The actual recurrence score takes priority over codes XX4 and XX5.  \n\n**Note 3:** Record only the results of an Oncotype Dx-Invasive recurrence score in this data item. If some other test is used for scoring, assign code XX9.\n\n**Note 4:** In cases where Oncotype DX is reported on more than one breast tumor specimen, record the highest value. \n\n**Note 5:** Staging for Breast cancer now depends on the Oncotype-Dx-Invasive recurrence score. Score of less than 11 indicates a pertinent cut off value for staging purposes.  \n\n**Note 6:** If the only information available is the Oncotype Dx-Invasive Risk Level, assign XX7.",
