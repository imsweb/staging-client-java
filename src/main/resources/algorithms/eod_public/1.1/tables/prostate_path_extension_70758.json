  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Only use histologic information from prostatectomy, including simple prostatectomy with negative margins, and autopsy in this field.  Information from biopsy of extraprostatic sites is coded in EOD Primary Tumor.\n\n**Note 2:** Code 900 if there is no prostatectomy performed within the first course of treatment.\n\n**Note 3:** Limit information in this field to first course of treatment in the absence of disease progression. \n\n**Note 4:** When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found. \n\n**Note 5:** Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the extension code. \n\n**Note 6:** \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign this to code 700.",
