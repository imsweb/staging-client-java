The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** Of the three tumor markers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the least specific for testicular cancer. The magnitude of LDH elevation directly correlates with Testis tumor burden.",
