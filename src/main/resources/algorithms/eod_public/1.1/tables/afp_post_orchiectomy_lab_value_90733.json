  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** Record the lab value of the AFP test results documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** If the initial post-orchiectomy AFP remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest AFP value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again. \n\n**Note 4:** A lab value expressed in micrograms/liter (ug/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in ng/mL.\n\n**Note 5:** If the pre-orchiectomy AFP was normal, a post-orchiectomy AFP may not be performed. In this case, code XXXXX.9 should be recorded.\n\n**Note 6:** If the only information available is a statement of elevated or normal, code XXXXX.9.\n\n**Note 7:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in AFP Post-Orchiectomy Range [NAACCR Data Item #3806].",
