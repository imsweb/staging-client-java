  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  All lymph node (regional and distant) involvement is coded in this field.\n* Peripheral nodes (e.g., palpable/accessible nodes) may be used to code this. \n* Central nodes (code 700) (deep/non-palpable nodes) are only included when they are microscopically proven\n\n**Note 2:** Regional node involvement (clinical abnormal peripheral lymph nodes) can be clinically involved despite negative biopsy or a lack of microscopic confirmation. \n\n**Note 3:**  Dutch grade system includes\n- Grade 1 - Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy (DL)\n- Grade 2 - Early involvement by mycosis fungoides (MF), (presence of cerebriform nuclei larger than 7.5 micrometers (um))\n- Grade 3 - Partial effacement of lymph node architecture; many atypical cerebriform mononuclear cells (CMCs)\n- Grade 4 - Complete effacement of lymph node architecture\n\n**Note 4:**  National Cancer Institute - Lymph Nodes (NCI LN) grade system includes\n- LN 0 - No atypical lymphocytes\n- LN 1 - Occasional and isolated atypical lymphocytes not arranged in clusters\n- LN 2 - Many atypical lymphocytes or in 3-6 cell clusters\n- LN 3 - Aggregates of atypical lymphocytes; nodal architecture preserved\n- LN 4 - Partial/complete effacement of nodal architecture by atypical lymphocytes or frankly neoplastic cells\n\n**Note 5:**  A T-cell clone (clone negative or clone positive) is defined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor gene (TCR).",
