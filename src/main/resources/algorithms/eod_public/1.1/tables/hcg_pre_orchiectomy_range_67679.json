The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** A lab value expressed in International Units/liter (IU/L) is equivalent to the same value expressed in milli-International Units/milliliter (mIU/mL).\n\n**Note 4:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in hCG Pre-orchiectomy Lab Value [NAACCR Data Item #3848].",
