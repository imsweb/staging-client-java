  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of the Multigene Signature Method can be used to code this data item.\n\n**Note 2:** Multigene signatures or classifiers are assays of a panel of genes from a tumor specimen, intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of response to chemotherapy and to evaluate prognosis or the likelihood of future metastasis.  \n* Only record tests done on tumor tissue that help determine if the cancer is likely to recur.  Don’t include other tests, such as those that evaluate hereditary mutations that influence a patient’s risk of developing cancer (e.g. myRisk, BRCA)\n* Only record tests that are based on gene assays. Don’t include other tests which use a multivariate data model to eliminate the need for genetic assays\n\n**Note 3:** Code the type of test performed. The same test should be used to record information in 3895: Multigene Signature Results.\n\n**Note 4:** Oncotype Dx tests are not recorded in this data item. See the following data items for Oncotype Dx.\n* 3903: Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS\n* 3904: Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-Invasive\n* 3905: Oncotype Dx Risk Level-DCIS \n* 3906: Oncotype Dx Risk Level-Invasive",
