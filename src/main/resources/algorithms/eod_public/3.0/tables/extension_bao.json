  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code 000 (behavior code 2) includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial), or described as in situ. \n\n**Note 2:** Code 050 (behavior code 3) includes the following:\n* Intramucosal, NOS\n* Lamina propria\n* Mucosa, NOS\n* Confined to, but not through the muscularis mucosa\n\n**Note 3:** Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is coded as 600 or 700. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be coded to 100-500.\n\n**Note 5:** The colon and rectum may be entirely peritonealized, partially peritonealized, or non-peritonealized. Use this list to help distinguish between EOD Primary Tumor codes 300 and 400 (See Note 6).\n* Entirely peritonealized segments: Cecum, Transverse colon, Sigmoid colon, Rectosigmoid colon\n* Segmental surfaces that are peritonealized: Anterior and lateral surfaces of: Ascending colon, Descending colon, Hepatic flexure, Splenic flexure, Upper third of rectum. Anterior surface: Middle third of rectum.\n* Entirely non-peritonealized segment: Lower third of rectum\n* Segmental surfaces that are non-peritonealized: Posterior surface of: Ascending colon, Descending colon, Hepatic flexure, Splenic flexure, Upper two-thirds of rectum\n\n**Note 6:** Invasion into “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” can be either code 300 or 400, depending on the primary site and whether it is peritonealized (fully or partially) or not. When extension is described as “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue”\n* Code 300 may NOT be used for entirely peritonealized sites (cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid colon), as this would be equivalent to peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissue invasion (code 400)\n* Code 300 may ONLY be used for peritonealized sites (See Note 5) when the extension is described using other terms listed under code 300 (ex. subserosal fat).  If there are no other terms used to describe the extension, other than invasion of “pericolorectal tissue”, then assign code 400\n* For partially peritonealized sites (See Note 5), “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” may indicate invasion of either non-peritonealized (code 300) or peritonealized tissue (code 400)\n  * Check for mention of serosa/peritoneum in the operative report and/or pathology report final diagnosis or gross description to determine the correct code. Again, if other descriptions besides “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” are used, assign code 300 or 400 based on the terminology used\n* If the pathologist does not further describe the “pericolic/perirectal tissues” as either “non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” vs “peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” and the operative report and/or gross description does not describe the tumor relation to the serosa/peritoneal surface, and it cannot be determined whether the tumor arises in a peritonealized portion of the colon, code 300.\n\n**Note 7:** Tumors characterized by involvement of the serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) by direct extension or perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal surface through inflammation are coded to 500.",
