Only code FIGO stage in this field, do not code FIGO grade.\n* Code FIGO grade in the grade fields\n\n**Note 3:** If there is more than one FIGO stage provided from the clinical and pathological work up, code the most extensive FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 4:** For High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) or serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) (8441/2), assign the FIGO stage based on the managing physician's documentation of FIGO. (See Note 1)\n* If FIGO stage for HGSC or STIC is not documented by the managing physician, code unknown (code 99)\n* Do not code 97 (in situ) for HGSC or STIC since FIGO does not have a Stage 0\n* If diagnosis is low grade serous intraepithelial carcinoma (LGSC) (8441/2) or serous intraepithelial carcinoma (no grade stated) (8441/2), code 97\n\n**Note 5:** Code 97 for any remaining in situ histologies (/2) since the FIGO stage definitions do not include Stage 0.",
