The LDH must be taken prior to systemic (chemo, immunotherapy, hormone), radiation therapy or surgery to a metastatic site. The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** If there is no mention of the LDH, code 9.\n\n**Note 4:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in 3870: LDH Upper Limits of Normal and 3932: LDH Lab Value.",
