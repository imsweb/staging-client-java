  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of extranodal extension (ENE) pathologically during a lymph node dissection or physician pathological stage indicating the absence or presence of ENE can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** Extranodal extension is defined as “the extension of a nodal metastasis through the lymph node capsule into adjacent tissue.” ENE is the preferred terminology. Other names include: extranodal spread, extracapsular extension, or extracapsular spread.\n* “A regional node extending into a distant structure or organ is categorized as ENE and is not recorded as distant metastatic disease.” \n\n**Note 3:** Code the status of ENE assessed on histopathologic examination of **surgically resected** involved regional lymph node(s). Do not code ENE from a lymph node biopsy (FNA, core, incisional, or the absence of ENE from a sentinel). Do not code ENE for any distant lymph nodes. Code the status of ENE based on the following criteria\n* Code 0.0\n  * Absence of ENE, positive lymph nodes assessed by lymph node dissection\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 3-7\n* Codes 0.1-9.9, X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4 as appropriate for\n  * Presence of ENE assessed by Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy\n  * Presence of ENE assessed by lymph node biopsy\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 2-7\n* Code X.7 as appropriate for\n  * Lymph nodes negative for cancer assessed by Sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 2-7\n* Code X.9\n  * Absence of ENE, positive lymph nodes assessed by Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy\n     * A positive Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy cannot assess the absence of ENE, only the presence of it. This is because there is not enough surrounding tissue in a Sentinel Lymph node biopsy to accurately assess ENE\n\n* If codes 0.1-0.9, X.1-X.7 are used, this indicates that the lymph nodes were surgically resected or a Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy was done and Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery [NAACCR Data Item: 1292] must be 2-7\n\n**Note 4:** Be aware that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.\n\n**Note 5:** Definitions of ENE subtypes and rules:\n* Microscopic ENE [ENE (mi)] is defined as less than or equal to 2 mm.\n* Major ENE [ENE (ma)] is defined as greater than 2 mm.\n* Both ENE (mi) and ENE (ma) qualify as ENE (+) for definition of pN.\n\n**Note 6:** The measurement of ENE is the distance from the lymph node capsule in millimeters (mm).",
