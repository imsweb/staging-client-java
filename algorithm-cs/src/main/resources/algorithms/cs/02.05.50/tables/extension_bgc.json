  "notes" : "**Note 1**: Osseous plasmacytomas are localized tumors occurring in the bone.  There may be soft tissue extension. \n\n**Note 2**: Extraosseous (extramedullary) plasmacytomas are plasma cell neoplasms that arise in tissues other than bone. The most common sites are the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, bladder, central nervous system (CNS), breast, thyroid, testis and skin. \n\n**Note 3**: Criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma include: presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells or plasmacytoma, presence of an M-protein in serum and/or urine, and the presence of related organ or tissue impairment. Do not use this criteria to determine the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Code according to histologic confirmation or physician statement according to the AJCC 7th edition. \n\n**Note 4**: Multiple myeloma or plasma cell myeloma is a widely disseminated plasma cell neoplasm, characterized by a single clone of plasma cells derived from B cells that grows in the bone marrow. It is always coded to 810 or 820 for systemic involvement.",
