  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The determination of AJCC stage group from T, N, M, and grade for EsophagusGEJunction depends further on histologic type.  Since squamous cell carcinoma typically has a poorer prognosis than adenocarcinoma, a tumor of mixed histopathologic type (including a squamous component or NOS histology) or a type that is not otherwise specified should be staged as squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n**Note 2**:  This table shows the selection of the appropriate version of the AJCC Stage table based on histology.  In the table below, Squamous maps to the table AJCC TNM 7 Stage Squamous, and Adenocarcinoma maps to the table AJCC TNM 7 Stage Adenocarcinoma.",
