  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  Bilateral nodes are considered regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3**:  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for AJCC staging but may be distant for Summary Stage.  Use code 100 for involvement of nodes in secondary nodal basins not otherwise specified.\n\n**Note 4**:  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded in CS Lymph Nodes. \n\n**Note 5**:  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be considered positive nodes. If only ITCs are present, defined as any tumor deposits in lymph nodes less than or equal to 0.2 mm, use code 010. \n\n**Note 6**:  If the only information about lymph nodes is a statement of N1 involvement without a clinical or pathologic designation, use code 360.",
  "footnotes" : "- When CS Lymph Nodes Eval is coded, for CS Lymph Nodes codes 010-360 ONLY, the N category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Lymph Nodes Eval and CS Site-Specific Factor 3, Clinical Status of Lymph Node Mets, as shown in the Lymph Node and Nodal Status Eval AJCC 7 Table.  When CS Lymph Nodes Eval is blank, for CS Lymph Nodes codes 010-360 ONLY, the N category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Site-Specific Factor 3, Clinical Status of Lymph Node Mets, and Regional Nodes Positive, as shown in the Lymph Node and Nodal Status Eval Blank AJCC 7 Table.",
