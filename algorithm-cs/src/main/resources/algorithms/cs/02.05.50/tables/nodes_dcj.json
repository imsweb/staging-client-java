Distant lymph node involvement was considered M1 for AJCC 6 staging, and was coded in CS Mets at DX in CS Version 1.\n\n**Note 2**: When coding Regional Nodes Positive and Regional Nodes Examined, only include regional nodes. Do not include distant nodes coded in CS Lymph Nodes. If the only information available is for lymph nodes, NOS, coded as 800 in CS Lymph Nodes, assume these are regional nodes for coding Regional Nodes Positive and Regional Nodes Examined.",
