Record the absence or presence of pleural effusion and specifically, if present, whether the pleural effusion is non-malignant, malignant, or NOS.\n\n**Note 2**: If imaging indicates a pleural effusion but pleural fluid cytology is described as negative for malignant cells, assign code 010.\n\n**Note 3**: If pleural fluid cytology is described as suspicious/suspicious for mesothelioma, assign code 020.\n\n**Note 4**: If pleural fluid cytology is described as atypical/atypical mesothelial cells (not specifically non-malignant or malignant), assign code 030.",
