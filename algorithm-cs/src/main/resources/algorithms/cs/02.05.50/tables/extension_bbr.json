  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  For AJCC TNM staging, peritoneal sarcomas are classified as deep tumors.\n\n**Note 2**:  The assignment of T1 and T2 categories for soft tissue sarcomas is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category.  Use codes 350 and 375 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-800 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-800 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.",
