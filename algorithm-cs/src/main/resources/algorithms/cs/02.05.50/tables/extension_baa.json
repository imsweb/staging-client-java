  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade II III are not normally collected by cancer registries.  AIN II III or AIN III is reportable to standard-setters (except the Commission on Cancer).  If your registry collects any of these, use code 000.\n\n**Note 2**:  The assignment of T1, T2 , and T3 categories for tumors of the anus is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category. Use code 310, 320, 330, or 850 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code incidental finding of malignancy in hemorrhoid according to greatest extension of tumor into wall of anus.  Code as Localized, NOS if extension not specified.\n\n**Note 4**:  Codes 400-750 are used for contiguous extension from the site of origin.  Discontinuous involvement is coded in CS Mets at DX.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-400 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-400 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.",
