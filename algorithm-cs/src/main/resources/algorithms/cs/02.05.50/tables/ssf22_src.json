  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Profound immune suppression may greatly increase the risk of developing Merkel cell carcinoma. Immune suppression is suppression of the body's immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases. Immune suppression may be deliberately induced with drugs, as in preparation for bone marrow or other organ transplantation, to prevent rejection of the donor tissue. It may also result from certain diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or lymphoma, and from the use of anti-cancer drugs.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the patient's history of profound immune suppression condition(s) as documented by the physician.",
