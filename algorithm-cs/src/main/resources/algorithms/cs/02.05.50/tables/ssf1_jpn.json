This might include:  physical examination, imaging, diagnostic lymph node biopsy and exploratory surgery (without a resection).\n\n**Note 2**:  In the rare instance that the number of clinically positive nodes is stated but a clinical N category is not stated, code 1-2 nodes as 100 (N1), 3-6 nodes as 200 (N2), and 7 or more nodes as 300 (N3).\n\n**Note 3**:  If there is no diagnostic workup to assess regional lymph nodes, use code 999.  Do not apply the inaccessible nodes rule that presumes unmentioned nodes to be negative.",
