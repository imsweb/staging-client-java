  "notes" : "**Note 1**: Clinical assessment can be by physical examination or imaging. According to AJCC, \"ECS [extracapsular spread] can be diagnosed clinically by a matted mass of nodes adherent to overlying skin, adjacent soft tissue, or clinical evidence of cranial nerve invasion. Radiologic signs of ECS include amorphous, spiculated margins of a metastatic node and stranding of the perinodal soft tissue in previously untreated patients.\"\n\n**Note 2**: Code the status of extracapsular extension assessed clinically for any involved regional lymph node(s) coded in the CS Lymph Nodes field. Do not code extracapsular extension for any nodes coded in CS Mets at DX in this field.\n\n**Note 3**: If nodes are involved clinically, and documentation of physical examination or imaging is available without a statement of extracapsular extension, use code 010.\n\n**Note 4**: If the only documentation is a reference to clinically involved nodes with no reference to extracapsular extension, use code 030.\n\n**Note 5**: If there is no information about clinical assessment of nodes, use code 999.",
