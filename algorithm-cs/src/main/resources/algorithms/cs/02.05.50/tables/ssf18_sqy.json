  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods such as Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) or CAM 5.2 or pancytokeratins. For Merkel cell carcinoma, the presence of ITCs in regional lymph node(s) is considered as positive nodal involvement.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the status of ITCs as documented by the pathologist.\n\n**Note 3**:  If regional lymph nodes are removed and are pathologically negative with no mention of ITC status, assume there are no ITCs and assign code 000.\n\n**Note 4**:  Use code 999 if nodes are clinically involved but no pathologic examination of regional nodes is performed.",
