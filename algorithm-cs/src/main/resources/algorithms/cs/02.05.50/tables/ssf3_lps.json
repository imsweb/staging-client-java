The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.   For example, code a pretreatment AFP of 20 ng/ml as 002; code pretreatment AFP of 11,000 ng/ml as 200.\n\n**Note 3**:  A lab value expressed in micrograms per liter (ug/l) is equivalent to the same value expressed in ng/ml.\n\n**Note 4**:  Code any measured value less than or equal to 1.0 ng/ml as 001.\n\n**Note 5**:  If the test was done but the actual value is not stated, code 997.",
