  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Sezary cells are circulating atypical, malignant T lymphocytes with hyperconvoluted cerebriform nuclei, with a mature memory T-cell phenotype (CD3+, CD4+) with loss of CD 7 and CD26.\n\n**Note 2**:  Assessment of blood tumor burden is performed using two types of tests:\n\n* A. Using the microscope to count neoplastic (Sezary) cells.  The results can be given as counts per cubic millimeter (mm3) or as a percentage of the total lymphocytes that are abnormal (Sezary cells).  \n* B. Flow cytometry to characterize the cell surface markers on the neoplastic cells, where the neoplastic cells show the loss of some specific markers (CD26, for example.)  Interpretation of the test results is complicated and may vary.  In addition, clonality may be assessed as explained in Note 4.  \n\n**Note 3**:  The categories for peripheral blood involvement are: \n\n* B0: No significant blood involvement \n* B1: Low blood tumor burden     \n* B2: High blood tumor burden. \n\n**Note 4**:  Clonality may be assessed on tissue and blood samples for this disease.  The tests look for what is called \"TCR gene rearrangement\" a detectable genetic pattern of the T-cell receptors on the neoplastic T-cells.  A finding of \"monoclonal\" means the cells have derived from a single ancestor cell.  In this staging system, \"monoclonal\" is termed \"clone +\" or \"clone positive,\" and this generally indicates a worse prognosis.  \"Polyclonal\" means the cells in question have not derived from a single ancestor cell, and this finding is termed \"clone -\" or \"clone negative.\" This may indicate a better prognosis.  Test methods for clonality include Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  If clonality is given but a B rating is not stated by the physician, use code 090.\n\n**Note 5**:  Record the B rating as stated by the physician.  If counts or percentages of neoplastic cells, flow cytometry test results, and/or clonality test results are performed but a B rating is not stated by the physician, use code 090.\n\n**Note 6**:  If there is no peripheral blood involvement or Sezary cell count is less than 1000, code 030.",
