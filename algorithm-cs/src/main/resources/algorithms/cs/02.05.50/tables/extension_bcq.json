  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The bones of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity include the maxilla, the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate, the labyrinth and inferior concha of the ethmoid. The roof of the nasal cavity is formed by the nasal bone. The floor of the nasal cavity, which forms the roof of the mouth, is composed of the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly.\n\n**Note 2**:  \"Bony invasion\" does not include extension to palate, cribriform plate, or pterygoid plates.  Extension to these structures is coded separately.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code Base of skull NOS only if no information is available to code to more specific bony structures in the skull.\n\n**Note 4**:  In code 700, \"minimal extension to anterior cranial fossa\" implies tumor pushing through the cribriform plate, but without invasion of the dura or brain.\n\n**Note 5**:  Use code 300 for localized tumor only if no information Is available to assign code 100, 110, 200, or 410.\n\n**Note 6**:  Use code 110, 410, 680, 725, 810, or 815  if the physician's assignment of T category is the only information available about the extent of the tumor.",
