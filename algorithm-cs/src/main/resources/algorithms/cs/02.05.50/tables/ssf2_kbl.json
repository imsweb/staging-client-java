The three dimensions of tumor size (length, width and height) are also important to collect if documented in the patient record.  Record the largest dimension of tumor size CS Tumor Size.  Record the second largest dimension of tumor size in CS Site-Specific Factor 1 and the smallest dimension of tumor size in CS Site-Specific Factor 2.\n\n**Note 2**:  Tumor size expressed as 4.0 centimeter (cm) x 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm is recorded as follows:\n\n* CS Tumor Size:  040\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 1:  030\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 2: 020\n\nTumor size expressed as \"greater than 8 cm\" is recorded as follows:\n\n* CS Tumor Size :  997\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 1:  999\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 2:  999",
