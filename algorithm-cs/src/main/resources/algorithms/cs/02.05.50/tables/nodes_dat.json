  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  Regional lymph nodes for any part of the esophagus fall in the range from periesophageal/cervical to the celiac region.  Contralateral and bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes are included.  However, AJCC has clarified that some nodal chains in this large area are partially regional and partially distant because they include both nodes that are close to the esophagus toward the body's midline and nodes that run laterally away from the esophagus or perpendicular to it.  Regional nodes are those that lie in the bed of the esophagus.  Examples:  regional supraclavicular nodes (level 1), regional pulmonary ligament nodes (level 9), regional hilar tracheobronchial nodes (level 10), or regional diaphragmatic nodes (level 15) are only those nodes closest to the esophagus; nodes in these chains that are further from the esophagus are distant.  Medical record terminology is unlikely to be so specific in describing involved node locations, so try to correlate involved node information with staging statements that indicate whether the nodes were considered regional or distant by the physicians; lacking such physician guidance, presume regional nodes.  If the record just indicates involvement of supraclavicular nodes, for example, and there is no further information available, presume that the involved nodes were close to the esophagus and regional.\n\n**Note 3**:  Over time the celiac and cervical nodes have been coded in both CS Mets at DX and CS Lymph Nodes, depending on the subsite.  Code all nodes that are regional per AJCC 7th Ed. staging (see Notes 2 and 4) in CS Lymph Nodes, but be aware that cervical and celiac nodes are in CS Mets at DX for legacy data whose codes were not updated under CSv2.\n\n**Note 4**:  Lymph node stations/groups from AJCC 7th Ed. chapter 10 are listed in parentheses when applicable.  For a descriptive list of these nodal groups, see  Part I Section 2 or Figure 10.3 from the AJCC Cancer Staging Atlas, 2nd Ed. or errata for AJCC 7th Ed. chapter 10.  AJCC has clarified the status of the most distal node chains for the esophagus/esophagogastric junction chapter.  The left gastric artery and celiac nodes (levels 17, 20) are regional, but the common hepatic and splenic artery nodes (levels 18, 19) are not regional.  See code 15 in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 5**:  Imaging studies often refer to involved nodes in the gastrohepatic ligament or at the gastrohepatic level for esophageal primaries.  Code as left gastric nodes if there is no more specific information.\n\n**Note 6**:  The number of positive regional nodes is required to calculate the correct N category for this schema.  Use codes 560, 610 or 710 when the pathology report assigns an N1, N2 or N3 category but does not specify the number of nodes involved, or the record identifies an N1, N2 or N3 category but the specific information about number of nodes involved is not available.  Use codes (100-255, 265-280 and 305-500) rather than codes 560, 610 or 710 when information about the number of positive nodes is available, or when nodes are clinically positive but not removed for examination.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Lymph Nodes codes 100-255, 265-280, and 305-500 ONLY, the N category  for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the number of positive lymph nodes; when CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 1, 9 and CS Coding System Original is before CS V02.05, the N category is assigned from the Lymph Nodes Clinical Eval Prior to V02.05 AJCC 7 Table, using Regional Nodes Positive and CS Site-Specific Factor 1; when CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 0, 5 OR (CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 1, 9 and CS Coding System Original is at least V02.05), the N category is assigned from Lymph Nodes Clinical Eval V02.05 AJCC 7 Table, using CS Site-Specific Factor 1; when CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 2, 3, 6, 8, or not coded, the N category is determined from the Lymph Nodes Patholologic Evaluation AJCC 7 Table Also Used When CS Lymph Nodes Eval Is Not Coded, using Regional Nodes Positive.",
