This variable is based on CS Site-Specific Factors 9, 11, 13, and 14.\n\n**Note 2**:  If both an IHC and a gene-amplification test (FISH or CISH) are performed, record the result of the gene-amplification test in this field.  However, if the gene-amplification test is given first and the result is borderline or equivocal and an IHC test is done to clarify these equivocal results, code the result of the IHC test.\n\n**Note 3**:  If the results of one test are available, and it is known that a second test is performed but the results are not available, use code 997.",
