  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  According to AJCC tumor size is an important prognostic factor.  The three dimensions of tumor size (length, width, and height) are also important to collect if documented in the patient record.  Record the largest dimension of tumor size in CS Tumor Size.   Record the second largest dimension of tumor size in CS Site-Specific Factor 1 and the smallest dimension of tumor size in CS Site-Specific Factor 2.\n\n**Note 2**:  Tumor size expressed as 4.0 centimeter (cm) x 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm is recorded as follows:\n\n* CS Tumor Size:  040\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 1:  030\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 2: 020\n\nTumor size expressed as \"greater than 8 cm\" is recorded as follows:\n\n* CS Tumor Size :  997\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 1:  999\n* CS Site-Specific Factor 2:  999\n\n**Note 3**:  The assignment of T1and T2 categories for tumors of bone is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category.  Use codes 996 and 997as appropriate to code CS Tumor Size based on a statement of T when no other size information is available.",
