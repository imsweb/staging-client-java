  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are considered regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3**:  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for AJCC staging but may be distant for Summary Stage.  Use code 250 for involvement of nodes in secondary nodal basins not specified in codes 100 and 200.\n\n**Note 4**:  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded in CS Lymph Nodes.\n\n**Note 5**:  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be considered positive nodes. If only ITCs are present, defined as any tumor deposits in lymph nodess less than or equal to 0.2mm,  use code 010.\n\n**Note 6**:  If the only information about lymph nodes is a statement of N1 involvement without a clinical or pathologic designation, use code 360.",
  "footnotes" : "- When CS Lymph Nodes Eval is coded, for CS Lymph Nodes codes 010-370 ONLY, the N category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Lymph Nodes Eval and CS Site-Specific Factor 3, Status of Lymph Node Mets, as shown in the Lymph Nodes and Nodal Status Eval AJCC 7 Table.  When CS Lymph Nodes Eval is blank, for CS Lymph Nodes codes 010-370 ONLY, the N category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Site-Specific Factor 3, Status of Lymph Node Mets, and Regional Nodes Positive, as shown in the Lymph Nodes and Nodal Status Eval Blank AJCC 7 Table.",
