  "notes" : "**Note 1**: For skin, patch indicates any size skin lesion without significant elevation or induration.\n\n**Note 2**: For skin, plaque indicates any size skin lesion that is elevated or indurated.\n\n**Note 3**: For skin, tumor indicates at least one 1 centimeter (cm) diameter solid or nodular lesion with evidence of depth and/or vertical growth. If a physician describes a skin lesion of less than 1 cm as a tumor, use code 550.\n\n**Note 4**: Use code 150 when skin involvement is present but only a general location/site is mentioned (i.e., face, torso, arms, legs). Use code 300 when there is skin involvement but there is no mention of location/site.\n\n**Note 5**: Ignore erythroderma if stated to involve less than 50% of the skin. Use codes 110-150, 210-230, 300, 550, 600.\n\n**Note 6**: Physicians use more than one method to estimate percentage of skin involvement by mycosis fungoides (MF).  Code percent of skin involvement as stated by the physician.  If no percentage is stated and no word such as localized or generalized is used and no stage is given, code as percent not stated.\n\n**Note 7**:  Use code 950 ONLY if there is no evidence of any type of skin involvement, including plaques, papules, patches, or tumors.  Tumor size is coded as 000 in CS Tumor Size only if there is no evidence of any tumor(s) as defined in the CS Tumor Size table note.",
