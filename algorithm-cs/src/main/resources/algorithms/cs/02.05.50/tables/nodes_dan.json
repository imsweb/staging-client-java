  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Note 2 specifies when to code certain tumor deposits (TD) here.  Distant nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules in the pericolorectal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule(s) may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node.  If this is the only information on lymph nodes, use code 050. The total number of TD must also be coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 4.  If there are TD and node involvement, code only the information on node involvement in this field; use a higher code number than 050. \n\n**Note 3**:  Inferior mesenteric nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX for cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and hepatic flexure. Superior mesenteric nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX for all colon sites.\n\n**Note 4**:  The number of positive regional nodes is required to calculate the correct N category for this schema.  Use codes 400-480 when the pathology report assigns an N1 or N2 category but does not specify the number of nodes involved, or the record identifies an N1 or N2 category but the specific information about number of nodes involved is not available.    Use codes 110-300 rather than codes 400-480 when information about the number of positive nodes is available, or when nodes are clinically positive but not removed for examination. \n\n**Note 5**:  Sigmoid nodes for descending colon have been moved from code 200 in CS Version 1 to code 220.",
  "footnotes" : "- For codes 100-300 ONLY: when CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 0, 1, 5, or 9, the N category is assigned from the Lymph Nodes Clinical Evaluation 6th Table, using Regional Nodes Positive and CS Site-Specific Factor 2; when CS Regional Nodes Eval is 2, 3, 6, 8, or not coded, the N category is determined from the Lymph Nodes Pathologic Evaluation 6th Table Also Used When CS Reg Nodes Eval is Not Coded using Regional Nodes Positive.\n- For codes 100-300 ONLY: when CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 1 or 9, and CS Coding System Original is before CS v02.05, the N category is assigned from the Lymph Nodes Clinical Eval prior to V02.05 7th Table using Regional Nodes Positive and CS Site-Specific Factor 2.  When CS Lymph Nodes Eval = 0, 5 OR (CS Lymph Nodes Eval is 1, 9 and CS Coding System Original is at least V02.05), the N category is assigned from Lymph Nodes Clinical Eval V02.05 AJCC 7th Table using Site-Specific Factor 2; when CS Regional Nodes Eval is 2, 3, 6, 8, or not coded, the N category is determined from the Lymph Nodes Pathologic Evaluation 7th Table Also Used When CS Reg Nodes Eval is Not Coded using Regional Nodes Positive.",
