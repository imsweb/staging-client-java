This information is also collected in this field as it may have an independent effect on prognosis.  \n\n**Note 2**:  Record the involvement of the corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosum as documented in the pathology report. Assign code 000 if surgical resection of the primary site is performed and includes corpus spongiosum and/or corpus cavernosum, the pathology report is available for review, and corpus spongiosum and/or corpus cavernosum involvement is not mentioned. If surgical resection of the primary site is performed without corpus spongiosum and/or corpus cavernosum included in the specimen, assign code 998.",
