When lymph node(s) is/are clinically or pathologically positive or metastasis is present, make sure that the FIGO stage reflects the combination of T, N, and M and NOT just the T. If a stage group is stated but it does not specify that it is a FIGO stage, assume that it is a FIGO stage and code it. Do not attempt to code FIGO stage based only on T, N, and M. If you cannot make a determination of stage based on the previous information, use code 999, stage unknown.",
