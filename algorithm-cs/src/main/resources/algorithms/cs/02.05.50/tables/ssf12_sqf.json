  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a tumor marker that has value in the management of certain malignancies.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record to the nearest tenth in Units/milliliter (U/ml) the highest CA 19-9 lab value documented in the medical record prior to treatment.  For example, a pretreatment CA 19-9 of 60  U/ml would be recorded as 600.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 U/ml (no measurable amount of CA 19 9).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 U/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 U/ml should be coded 001.  For code 001, also round 0.11-0.14 U/ml down to 0.1 U/ml.  For codes 002-980, round values to the nearest tenth of U/ml.\n\n**Note 4**:  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  For example, code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 U/mL\" as 005.\n\n**Note 5**:  Use code 997 if there is no actual pre-treatment CA 19-9 lab value available but an interpretation of the test result is stated.",
