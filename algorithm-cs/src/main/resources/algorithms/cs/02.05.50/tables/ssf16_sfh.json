  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Of the three tumor markers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the least specific for testicular cancer and is more of a determinant of bulky or disseminated disease. Although recommended to be tested, LDH may not be routinely performed, especially if the primary is localized.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the range of the LDH test as documented in the patient record after orchiectomy and prior to further treatment.\n\n**Note 3**: If the initial post-orchiectomy LDH test remains elevated, review the subsequent tests until normalization or plateau occurs and use that test to code this field. See Part I for further explanation of serum tumor marker half life.\n\n**Note 4**:  If the post-orchiectomy LDH test is unknown but the preorchiectomy LDH test was normal, use code 990.\n\n**Note 5**:  If the post-orchiectomy LDH test is unavailable but a physician's statement of the result is documented, use codes 991-993.\n\n**Note 6**:  For rare cases that are treated prior to orchiectomy or an orchiectomy is not performed, code the initial LDH range in this field and not in CS Site-Specific Factor 10.",
