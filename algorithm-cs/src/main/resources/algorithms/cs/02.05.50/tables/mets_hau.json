Cases in which one or more distant metastases are identified by clinical and/or radiographic methods are designated cM1. A case is classified as clinically free of metastasis (cM0) unless there is documented evidence of metastasis by clinical means or by biopsy of a metastatic site (pathologic).  Use code 99 if there is no documentation available for any staging assessment, or if there is reasonable doubt that the tumor is no longer localized and there is no documentation of distant metastasis.",
