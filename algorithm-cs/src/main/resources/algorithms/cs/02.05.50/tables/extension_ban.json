  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathologic description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II, use code 300 (Clark level IV).\n\n**Note 3**:  Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in CS Lymph Nodes.\n\n**Note 4**:  Ulceration of the melanoma is coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2.",
