  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The mitotic count, the number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF), is an element in a proposed grading scheme for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the gastrointestinal system.  This site-specific factor presumes the denominator of 10 HPF, so just the numerator (the mitotic count) is coded here.  For other schemas in which mitotic count is collected, the denominator may vary.\n\n**Note 2**:  As described in the AJCC chapter on NETs, 10 HPF at a magnficiation objective of 40 (40x) are equivalent to 2 square millimeters (mm).\n\n**Note 3**:  Record mitotic count to the nearest tenth as documented in the pathology report.  For example, a mitotic count of 3/10 HPF would be coded 030.\n\n**Note 4**:  Code the specific mitotic count only per 10 HPF or 2 square mm; assume the denominator is 10 HPF or 2 square mm if not specified.  Use code 996 only if the mitotic count is expressed with a specific denominator other than 10 HPF or 2 square mm.",
