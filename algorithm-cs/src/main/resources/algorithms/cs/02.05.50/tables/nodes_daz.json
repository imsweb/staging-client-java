Distant nodes, including presacral and lateral sacral (laterosacral) nodes, are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  The Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code CS Lymph Nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC  if  the stage value is assigned because of regional lymph node involvement or there is no indication of the basis.\n\n**Note 3**:  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume nodes are negative.\n\n**Note 4**:  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.\n\n**Note 5**:  Determination of the N category for AJCC 6 is based on this field and CS Mets at DX for specific codes in CS Mets at DX.",
