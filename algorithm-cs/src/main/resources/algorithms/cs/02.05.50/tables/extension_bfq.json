  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Ciliary body and Iris are both included in the ICD-O-3 site code of C69.4, but they are staged with different criteria by AJCC.  The Schema Discriminator is used to select the CS schema appropriate for coding extension for melanoma of the ciliary body.  Obsolete codes identified for primaries of the iris are found in this schema because melanomas of ciliary body and iris were included in a single schema in CS Version 1.\n\n**Note 2**:  Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris.  Melanomas of the iris tend to be small, and those arising from or extending to the ciliary body typically are large.\n\n**Note 3**:  AJCC does not recognize in situ melanoma of the ciliary body.  Any case so coded will be mapped to unknown AJCC stage, in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 4**:  The AJCC 7th Edition assigns a T value to combinations of measurements for basal diameter and thickness of tumor divided into four Tumor Size Categories in a charted format.  The AJCC 6th Edition assigns T values based on three pairs of measurements for basal diameter and thickness, using the basal diameter for classification when the two measurements do not fit into the defined pairs.\n\n**Note 5**:  According to the AJCC, \"In clinical practice the largest tumor basal diameter may be estimated in optic disc diameters (dd) (average: 1 dd = 1.5mm). Tumor thickness may be estimated in diopters (average: 2.5 diopters = 1 mm).  Other techniques, such as ultrasonography and fundus photography may provide a more accurate measurement.\n\n**Note 6**:  Use codes 160 and 180 if measurements are available to record the largest tumor basal diameter and tumor thickness.  Use codes 215-445 only if tumor measurements are not available for coding. Note that code 635, mapped to T4e, is not based on a Tumor Size Category assignment.\n\n**Note 7**:  Use codes 245, 295, 345, and 445 only  if the Tumor Size Category is the only information available about the tumor.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 160 and 180, the T for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the values of tumor basal diameter, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2, and thickness, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 3. Basal diameter and thickness are mapped to Tumor Size Categories in the Tumor Size Category AJCC 7 Table, and the CS Extension codes and Tumor Size Categories are mapped to T in the Extension Size Category AJCC 7 Table.\n- For CS Extension codes 160, 180, 635, and 640, the T for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the values of tumor basal diameter, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2, and thickness, recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 3. Basal diameter and thickness are mapped to tumor size pairs in the Tumor Size Pair AJCC 6 Table, and the CS Extension codes and tumor size pairs are mapped to T in the Extension Size Pair AJCC 6 Table.",
