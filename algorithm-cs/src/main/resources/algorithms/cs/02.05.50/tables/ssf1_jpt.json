Record the actual measurement in tenths of millimeters (mm) from the pathology report.\n\n**Note 2**:  If tumor depth is noted on multiple specimens (two or more), record the greatest vertical or depth measurement noted on a single specimen; do not add measurements together.  Record in CS Site-Specific Factor 19 that the tumor was transected.\n\n**Note 3**:  If tumor is in situ (CS Extension code 000), code measured thickness as 999.",
