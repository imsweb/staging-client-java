  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Definition of Adjacent Connective Tissue:  Some of the schemes for ill-defined or non-specific sites in this manual contain a code 400, adjacent connective tissue, which is defined here as the unnamed tissues that immediately surround an organ or structure containing a primary cancer.  Use this code when a tumor has invaded past the outer border (capsule, serosa, or other edge) of the primary organ into the organ's surrounding supportive structures but has not invaded into larger structures or adjacent organs.\n\n**Note 2**:  Definition of Adjacent Structures: Connective tissues large enough to be given a specific name would be considered adjacent structures.  For example, the brachial artery has a name, as does the broad ligament.  Continuous tumor growth from one organ into an adjacent named structure would be coded to 600 in the schemas for ill-defined or non-specific sites.",
