  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The microsatellite instability (MSI) test is a genetic test performed on tumor tissue to look for differences in length of certain non-functioning sections of DNA.  The differences are caused by problems with the genes that normally repair DNA.  A high-positive MSI (MSI-H) result may indicate that the gene repair problem is related to the development of the cancer, and that the patient may have hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome.)  A low-positive or stable MSI result (stable meaning that there are no differences in the lengths) means it is unlikely that the cancer is related to a hereditary condition.  \n\n**Note 2**: Testing for MSI may be done by immunology or genetic testing.  Some laboratories only test for MSI via immunology.  Results from immunology will only provide you with positive or negative results and will not specify whether the MSI is low or high. If the testing was done via immunology, do not use codes 040 or 050.  Only genetic testing results will specify whether the MSI is low or high.",
