  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  AJCC 7th Edition T1 and T2 categories are based on size and high risk features and not depth of invasion or extension. AJCC 7th Edition includes a T3 category for head and neck skin primaries only.\n\n**Note 2**:  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with the greatest extension.\n\n**Note 3**:  Skin ulceration does not alter the AJCC T category. \n\n**Note 4**:  The assignment of the T1 category for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with one or no high-risk features is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T1 category may be used to code both CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. However the two fields are coded independently; for example, the record may document size but not extension.  Use codes 510, 520, 600, and 810 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 5**:  Use code 400 (Localized, NOS) when no further information is available to assign code 100, 500, 510, or 520.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100, 400, 500, 510, and 550 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the values of CS Tumor Size and CS Site-Specific Factor 12, High Risk Features, as shown in the Extension Size High Risk Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100, 400, 500 and 510 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6th Edition is assigned based on value of CS Tumor Size as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 6 Table for this schema.",
