For example, code a pretreatment CA 19-9 value of 60 U/ml as 600.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code 000 is reserved for exactly 0.0 U/ml (no measurable amount of CA 19 9).  Do not round tiny values down to 0.0 U/ml; any measured value less than or equal to 0.1 U/ml should be coded 001.  For code 001, also round 0.11-0.14 U/ml down to 0.1 U/ml.  For codes 002-979, round values to the nearest tenth of a U/ml.\n\n**Note 4**:  For an uncertain value, record the stated closest value.  For example, code a value stated as \"less than 0.5 U/ml\" as 005.",
