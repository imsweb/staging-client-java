  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The mitotic rate, the count of mitoses (also termed \"mitotic figures\") per 50 high-power fields (HPF), reflects the potential aggressiveness or prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and is used alone to determine their histologic grade (low or high).  The mitotic rate is also a factor in assigning the AJCC 7 anatomic stage/prognostic group.  This site-specific factor presumes the denominator of 50 HPF or its equivalent, so just the numerator (the mitotic count) is coded here.  For other schemas in which mitotic count is collected, the denominator may vary.\n\n**Note 2**:  A HPF usually has a magnification objective of 40 (a 40x field).  As described in the AJCC chapter on GIST, 50 HPF are equivalent to viewing a total area of 5 square millimeters (mm) at 40x magnification.\n\n**Note 3**:  Record mitotic count, to the nearest tenth of a mitosis, as documented in the pathology report.  For example, a mitotic count of 6/50 HPF, or 6 per 5 square mm, would be coded 060.\n\n**Note 4**:  Code the specific mitotic count only per 50 HPF or 5 square mm; assume the denominator is 50 HPF or 5 square mm if not specified. \n\n**Note 5**:  Use code 996 for a description of mitoses, NOS, or if the mitotic count is expressed with a specific denominator other than 50 HPF or 5 square mm.",
