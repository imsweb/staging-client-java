  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  AJCC 7th Edition T1 and T2 categories are based on size and high risk features and not depth of invasion or extension.  AJCC 7th Edition does not include a T3 category for scrotum.\n\n**Note 2**:  The assignment of the T1 category for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with one or no high-risk features is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T1 category may be used to code both CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. However the two fields are coded independently; for example, the record may document size but not extension.  Use codes 310, 320, and 810 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 3**:  Use code 300 (Localized, NOS) when no further information is available to assign code 100, 305, 310, or 320.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-310 and 400-800 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size and CS Site-Specific Factor 12, High Risk Features, as shown in the Extension Size High Risk Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-310, 400, and 450 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 6 Table for this schema.",
