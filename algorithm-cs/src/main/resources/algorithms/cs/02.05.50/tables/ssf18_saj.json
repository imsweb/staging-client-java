  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) are isolated tumor cells (ITCs) (micrometastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) found in the bone marrow or other nonregional nodal tissues or organs.\n\n**Note 2**:  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with cytokeratin stains and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) are laboratory methods for identifying very small amounts of tumor cells in tissue. RT-PCR amplifies genetic material identified by probes for tumor genes to a detectable level.\n\n**Note 3**:  Any positive test takes precedence over a negative or borderline test.  Information about a known test takes precedence over no information about other tests.",
