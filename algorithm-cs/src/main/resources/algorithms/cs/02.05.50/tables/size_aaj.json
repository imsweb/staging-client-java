Use codes 990-995 only if a specific measurement is not available.\n\n**Note 2**:  The assignment of T1 and T2 categories for sarcomas of the orbit cavity is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category.  Use codes 991 and 992 as appropriate to code CS Tumor Size based on a statement of T when no other size information is available.",
