The upper limit of normal is needed to evaluate the LDH value recorded in CS Site-Specific Factor 5.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record upper limit of normal used for the LDH test as listed on the laboratory report or in the medical record. The information should be taken from the same test used to code CS Site-Specific Factor 4 and CS Site-Specific Factor 5.",
