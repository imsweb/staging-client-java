  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Include information from prostatectomy and autopsy in this field and not in CS Extension - Clinical Extension.  Only use histologic information from prostatectomy, including simple prostatectomy with negative margins, and autopsy in this field.  Information from biopsy of extraprostatic sites is coded in CS Extension - Clinical Extension; information from needle core biopsy of prostate is coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 14.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code 970 if there is no prostatectomy performed within the first course of treatment.\n\n**Note 3**:  Limit information in this field to first course of treatment in the absence of disease progression.\n\n**Note 4**:  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of prostate gland\" an impossible diagnosis.  Any case so coded is mapped to TX for AJCC stage and in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 5**:  When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found (for example, involvement in one lobe, both lobes, or more).\n\n**Note 6**:  When the apical margin, distal urethral margin, bladder base margin, or bladder neck margin is involved and there is no extracapsular extension, use code 400.\n\n**Note 7**:  Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the extension code.\n\n**Note 8**:  \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign this to code 600.\n\n**Note 9**:  For information regarding stage calculations, refer to CS Extension - Clinical Extension Note 8 and the Special Calculation extra tables.",
  "footnotes" : "For this site, extension is coded in two CS fields: CS Extension - Clinical Extension and CS Site-Specific Factor 3 - Pathologic Extension. The mapping values for the T category for AJCC stage, SS77, and SS2000 and the associated c, p, yp, or a indicator are assigned based on the values in CS Extension - Clinical Extension, CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval, and CS Site-Specific Factor 3 - Pathologic Extension as shown in the Special Calculation Table for TNM 7 Invasive/Unknown Pathologic Extension Eval, Special Calculation Table for TNM 7 Non-Invasive Pathologic Extension, Special Calculation Table for TNM 6 Invasive/Unknown Pathologic Extension Eval, Special Calculation Table for TNM 6 Non-Invasive Pathologic Extension, and Special Calculation Table for SEER Summary Stage.",
