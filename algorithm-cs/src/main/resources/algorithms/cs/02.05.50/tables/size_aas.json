  "notes" : "**Note**:  The assignment of T1 categories for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the small intestine is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code both CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. However the two fields are coded independently; for example, the record may document size but not extension.  Use code 991 as appropriate to code CS Tumor Size based on a statement of T when no other size information is available.",
