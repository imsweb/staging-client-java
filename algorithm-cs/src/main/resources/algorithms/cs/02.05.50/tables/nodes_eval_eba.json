  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  This field is used primarily to derive the staging basis for the N category in the TNM system.  It records how the code for the item \"CS Lymph Nodes\" was determined based on the diagnostic methods employed and their intent.\n\n**Note 2**:  In the 7th edition of the AJCC manual, the clinical and pathologic classification rules for the N category were changed to reflect current medical practice.  The N is designated as clinical or pathologic based on the intent (workup versus treatment) matching with the assessment of the T classification.  When the intent is workup, the staging basis is clinical, and when the intent is treatment, the staging basis is pathologic. \n\n* A. Microscopic assessment including biopsy of regional nodes or sentinel nodes, if being performed as part of the workup to choose the treatment plan, is therefore part of the clinical staging.  When it is part of the workup, the T category is clinical, and there has not been a resection of the primary site adequate for pathologic T classification (which would be part of the treatment).\n* B. Microscopic assessment of regional nodes if being performed as part of the treatment is therefore part of the pathologic staging.  When it is part of the treatment, the T category is pathologic, and there has been a resection of the primary site adequate for pathologic Tclassification (all part of the treatment).\n\n**Note 3**:  Microscopic assessment of the highest N category is always pathologic (code 3).\n\n**Note 4**:  If lymph node  dissection is not performed after neoadjuvant therapy, use code 0 or 1.\n\n**Note 5**:  Only codes 5 and 6  are used if the node assessment is performed after neoadjuvant therapy.",
