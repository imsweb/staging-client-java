  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  AJCC considers all anaplastic carcinomas to be T4.\n\n**Note 2**:  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of thyroid gland\" an impossible diagnosis.  Any case so coded is mapped to TX for AJCC stage and in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 3**:  The assignment of T1 and T2 categories for carcinoma of the thyroid is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code both CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. However the two fields are coded independently; for example, the record may document size but not extension.  Use codes 405, 410, 415, 420, 490, 560, 810, and 815 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 4**:  Use code 300 for localized tumor only if no information is available to assign codes 100, 200, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, or 490.\n\n**Note 5**:  Extension codes 405, 410, 415, 420, and 490 are not compatible with anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 000, 100-550, 950, and 999 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Extension Size SSF 1 AJCC 7 Table for all histologies except 8020, 8021, 8030, 8031, and 8032, or any other histology with grade equal to 4. For these histologies or grade 4, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Extension and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Histology Grade Extension SSF 1 AJCC 7 Table. \n- For CS Extension codes 560-700 and 730-815 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Extension and CS Site-Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Extension T4 SSF 1 AJCC 7 Table. \n- For CS Extension codes 000, 100-550, 950, and 999 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 6 Table for all histologies except 8020, 8021, 8030, 8031, and 8032, or any other histology with grade equal to 4. For these histologies or grade 4, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Extension as shown in the Histology Grade Extension AJCC 6 Table. \n- For CS Extension code 560 ONLY, the value for SS1977 and SS2000 is assigned based on the value of histology and grade as shown in the Histology Grade Extension Summary Stage Table.",
