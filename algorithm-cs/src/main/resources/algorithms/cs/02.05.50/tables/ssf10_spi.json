  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  This is a special molecular diagnostic test performed on tumor tissue to identify loss of genetic material normally found on the long arm of one of the patient's two copies of chromosome 18.  A normal cell will contain two complete copies of each chromosome, one from each parent, and this normal state is termed heterozygous.  Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an abnormal state reflecting damage to the chromosome that may mean that normal tumor suppression functions cannot take place.\n\n**Note 2**:  Other terms for LOH include gene deletion and allelic loss.",
