  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  AJCC recommends the Nottingham combined histologic grade (Elston-Ellis modification of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system).  Terms seen on pathology reports may include: Bloom-Richardson (BR), modified Bloom-Richardson, BR, BR grading, Scarff-Bloom-Richardson, SBR grading, , Elston-Ellis modification of Bloom-Richardson score, Nottingham modification of Bloom-Richardson score, Nottingham modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson, Nottingham-Tenovus grade, or Nottingham grade.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the highest score prior to neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code the tumor grade using the following priority order: a). BR scores 3-9; b). BR grade (low, intermediate, high).\n\n**Note 4**:  BR score may be expressed as a range, 3-9.  The score is based on three morphologic features of \"invasive no-special-type\" breast cancers (degree of tubule formation/histologic grade, mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism/nuclear grade of tumor cells).  If a report describes any of the factors with words (low, intermediate, high) rather than numbers, do not attempt to translate these words into a score or number; use codes 110-130.\n\n**Note 5**:  If only a grade of 1 through 4 is given with no information on the score and it is unclear if it is a Nottingham or BR Grade, code 999.\n\n**Note 6**:  Code the highest score prior to neoadjuvant treatment if multiple scores are reported.  For examples, different scores may be reported on multiple pathology reports for the same primary cancer; different scores may be reported for multiple tumors assigned to the same primary cancer.",
