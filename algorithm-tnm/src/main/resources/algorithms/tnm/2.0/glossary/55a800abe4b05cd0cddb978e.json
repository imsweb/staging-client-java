  "name" : "Adjacent tissue(s), NOS",
  "definition" : "The unnamed tissues that immediately surround an organ or structure containing a primary cancer. Use this category when a tumor has invaded past the outer border (capsule, serosa, or other edge) of the primary organ into the  organâ€™s surrounding supportive structures but has not invaded into larger structures or adjacent organs. The structures considered in ICD-O-3 as connective tissue include the following: adipose tissue; aponeuroses; arteries; blood vessels; bursa; connective tissue, NOS; fascia; fatty tissue; fibrous tissue; ganglia; ligaments; lymphatic channels (not nodes); muscle; nerves (spinal, sympathetic and peripheral); skeletal muscle; subcutaneous tissue; synovia; tendons;  tendon sheaths; veins; and vessels, NOS. In general, these  tissues do not have specific names. These tissues form the framework of many organs, provide support to hold organs in place, bind tissues and organs together, and serve as  storage sites for nutrients. Blood, cartilage and bone are sometimes considered connective tissues, but in this manual they would be listed separately.\n",
