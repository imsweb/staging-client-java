Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **Hepatoduodenal nodes** \n* Hepatoduodenal nodes are regional for primaries of the lesser curvature of the stomach (C165). \n* They are coded in EOD Mets for all other subsites in this schema.\n\n**Note 3:** **Metastatic nodules in the fat** \n* Metastatic nodules in the fat adjacent to a gastric carcinoma, without evidence of residual lymph node tissue, are classified as regional node metastases, but nodules implanted on peritoneal surfaces are classified as distant metastases (see EOD Mets).\n\n**Note 4:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.  \n* **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (300, 400) are used when\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, includes\n    * FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up **AND/OR**\n    * Lymph node dissection performed\n  * Pathological codes 300, 400 take priority over codes 450-800\n\n* **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (450-700) are used when the **only** information on nodal involvement is based on **physical exam or imaging** \n   * These codes are specifically for when there is no **microscopic confirmation** of regional lymph nodes (*Regional Nodes Positive = 98, 99*)\n   * **Note:** Use codes 300 or 400 if *Regional Nodes Positive is 01-90, 95*\n\n* Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological information\n  * **Code 000** is used when there is no evidence of regional lymph nodes clinically **OR** lymph nodes are negative pathologically (*Regional Nodes Positive = 00, 98*)\n  * **Code 800** is used when there are positive nodes (clinical or pathological), but the specific lymph nodes or number of positive nodes is unknown (*Regional Nodes Positive = 97*) \n  * **Code 999** is used when the lymph node status is unknown and *Regional Nodes Positive = 99*",
