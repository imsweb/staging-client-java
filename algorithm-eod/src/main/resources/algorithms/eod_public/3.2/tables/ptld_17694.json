  "description" : "Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) is a lymphoid proliferation arising in a recipient of a solid organ transplant, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or an umbilical cord blood transfusion. The patient must  have a history of a solid organ transplant or an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Both polymorphic and monomorphic PTLD are actually caused by post-transplant immunosuppression. Most cases of PTLD occur within a year of transplantation; however, they can occur any time after the transplant. Monomorphic PTLD may have histology indistinguishable from that of various malignant hematopoietic neoplasms, particularly lymphomas such as Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.",

This type of PTLD is NOT collected in this data item.\n* **Monomorphic PTLD (Code 1)**: This is the most common PTLD and is associated with a malignant hematopoietic neoplasm. Most common, but not limited to, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma \n* **(Classic Hodgkin lymphoma-PTLD type (Code 2)**: Under the microscope, Reed-Sternberg cells, which are associated with Hodgkin lymphoma are present\n* **PTLD, NOS (Code 4)**: Used when only PTLD (NOS) is documented and there is no mention of monomorphic or Hodgkin like type",
