  "description" : "Extranodal Extension (ENE) Pathological is defined as â€œthe extension of a nodal metastasis through the lymph node capsule into adjacent tissue.\" This data item defines pathological ENE for sites other than Head and Neck.\n\nExtranodal extension is defined as metastatic tumor growing from within the lymph node outward through the lymph node capsule and into surrounding connective tissues. \n* \"A regional node extending into a distant structure or organ is categorized as ENE and is not recorded as distant metastatic disease.\"\n\nThis data item is for ENE that is detected pathologically.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of Extranodal Extension (ENE) Pathological or physician pathological staging can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n  * Note that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for Coding**\n* Code the status of extranodal extension assessed on the **surgical resection** specimen for the most involved regional lymph node(s)\n* Do not code ENE for any distant lymph nodes.\n* Be aware that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.",
