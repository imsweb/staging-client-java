  "description" : "Percent Necrosis Post Neoadjuvant is a prognostic factor for bone sarcomas. \n\nFor osteosarcoma and Ewingâ€™s sarcoma/PNET, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a prognostic factor.  Patients with more than 90% tumor necrosis have a more favorable prognosis than those with less response.  The CAP protocol for bone tumor resection provides the pathologist with specific instructions for determining the percentage of tumor necrosis.  A separate method (system of Picci) may describe response to treatment in grades: grade I (macroscopic viable tumor), grade II (microscopic viable tumor), or grade III (no viable tumor).  Do not code the Picci grade system in this data item.",
