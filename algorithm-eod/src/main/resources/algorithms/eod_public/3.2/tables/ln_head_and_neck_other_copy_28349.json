  "coding_guidelines" : "**1)** Code all applicable levels that are involved\n* ***Example 1:*** A carcinoma of the base of tongue involves bilateral submandibular nodes and left upper, mid-, and lower jugular nodes, the largest measuring 4 cm. There is no extracapsular extension. These are level I, II, III, and IV lymph nodes according to AJCC definitions. \n    * **i.** Levels I-III: Code 7 (Levels I, II and III lymph nodes involved) to show that levels I, II, and III are involved\n     *\t**ii.** Levels IV-V: Code 1 to show that level IV is involved\n     *\t**iii.** Levels VI-VII: Code 0 for no other nodes involved\n    *\t**iv.** Head and Neck, Other: Code 0 for no other nodes involved\n\n**2)** If information is available on some nodes, but the others are unknown, code what is known. \n* ***Example:*** Multiple lymph nodes involved, level II documented, but the other levels not mentioned. Code 2 to indicate level II involvement.\n\n**3)** If a lymph node is described as involving two levels, or documented as a range, code both levels.\n* ***Example:*** Physical examination for a floor of mouth cancer describes a large lymph node mass low in level II stretching into Level III. Code 6 for Levels II-III because both Level II and Level III are mentioned.\n\n**4)** **Code 9** when the only information available is “Regional nodes, NOS” or “Cervical nodes, NOS” or “Internal jugular nodes, NOS” or “Lymph nodes, NOS. In other words, if regional nodes are known to be positive but the level(s) of nodes involved is unknown, code 9.\n* ***Example:*** Patient diagnosed elsewhere with carcinoma of oropharynx with cervical lymph node involvement. No other information available. All Head and Neck Level data items are coded to 9 since there is no specific information about the levels.  \n    * **i.** Levels I-III: Code 9\n    * **ii.** Levels IV-V: Code 9\n    * **iii.** Levels VI-VII: Code 9\n    * **iv.** Head and Neck, Other: Cod",
