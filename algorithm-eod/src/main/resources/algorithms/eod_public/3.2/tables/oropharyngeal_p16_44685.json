  "description" : "Staging for oropharyngeal cancers changed in the AJCC 8th edition. Chapter 10 is now for p16+ tumors, while Chapter 11 is for p16- negative tumors or where the p16 is not assessed or unknown. A schema discriminator is necessary to determine the p16 status so that the appropriate chapter/schema is used.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Schema discriminator for Oropharynx** \n* A schema discriminator is used to discriminate between oropharyngeal tumors that are p16 positive and oropharyngeal tumors that are p16 negative OR p16 status unknown. \n\n**Note 2:** **p16 testing** \n* Only the HPV p16+ test can be used. If another HPV test is done, code 9.\n  * **00100: Oropharynx HPV-Mediated (p16+) (see code 2)**\n    * Used for p16 (+) (positive) \n  * **00111: Oropharynx (p16-)** \n    * p16 expression of weak intensity or limited distribution (see code 1)\n    * p16 without an immunostaining performed (see code 9)",
