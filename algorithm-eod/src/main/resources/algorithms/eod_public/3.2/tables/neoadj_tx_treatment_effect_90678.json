  "description" : "This data item records the pathologistâ€™s statement of neoadjuvant treatment effect on the primary tumor from the surgical pathology report. Whenever treatment effect definitions are recommended by or available in CAP Cancer Protocols, this data item follows the CAP definitions indicating absent or present effect. When specific CAP definitions are not available, registrars should use treatment effect general use categories.",
  "notes" : "This data item provides information related to the quality of care and describes the pathological outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. This data item provides prognostically relevant information by quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression. Therefore, this item can provide a better risk stratification for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, this data item can contribute to assessments of cancer care quality.\n\nSee the [SEER Coding Manual](https://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2023/SPCSM_2023_MainDoc.pdf) for additional information.",
