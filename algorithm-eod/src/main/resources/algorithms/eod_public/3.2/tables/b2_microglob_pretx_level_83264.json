  "description" : "Serum Beta-2 Microglobulin is a protein that is found on the surface of many cells and plentiful on the surface of white blood cells.  Increased production or destruction of these cells causes Serum β2 (beta-2) Microglobulin level to increase. Elevated Serum β2 (beta-2) Microglobulin level is a prognostic factor for plasma cell myeloma.\n\nThe Revised International Staging System (RISS or R-ISS) is now used to stage plasma cell myeloma (9732/3), using several different criteria. The stages are based on the absence or presence of the following related criteria. \n* 3931: Serum Beta-2 Microglobulin Pretreatment Level\n* 3930: Serum Albumin Pretreatment Level\n* 3857: High Risk Cytogenetics\n* 3869: LDH Level\n\nRequired for Staging: The AJCC Staging System Plasma Cell Myeloma and Plasma Cell Disorders (9732/3 only) and EOD. \n* Note: RISS stage is not applicable for the descriptions of plasma multiple myeloma that are listed in the codes 1 and 9 in the SSDI Schema Discriminator 1: Plasma Cell Myeloma Terminology. If you have coded 1 or 9 for this Schema Discriminator, the four data items listed above are BLANK.\n\nThe RISS stages are\n* Stage I: Serum Beta-2-microglobulin <3.5 mg/L and serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL and no high-risk cytogenetics and Normal LDH\n* Stage II: Not R-ISS I or III\n* Stage III: Serum Beta-2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/L and high-risk cytogenetics and/or high LDH",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician statement**\n* Physician statement of Serum Beta-2-Microglobulin Pretreatment Level can be used to code this data item when no other information is available\n\n**Note 2:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record this data item based on a **blood test** performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment). Use the highest value available.\n  * Do not use results from a urine test\n\n**Note 3:** **Component of RISS Stage**\n* LDH level is part of the Revised International Staging (RISS). Use the cut points listed in the table below regardless of the lab’s reference range.",
