  "description" : "LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) Lab Value, measured in serum, is a predictor of treatment response, progression-free survival, and overall survival for patients with Stage IV melanoma of the skin. \n\nWhen cells (normal or tumor) are damaged or destroyed, an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is released into the bloodstream.  LDH is an indirect indication of possible tumor burden or damage to an organ, which may be caused by metastatic involvement of liver or lung, or a myocardial infarction.  The total LDH should be the test value that is coded, but there are five fractions of LDH that measure tissue specific cellular damage: LD1 and LD2:  heart, red blood cells and kidneys; LD3: lung; LD4 and LD5:  liver, skin, and skeletal muscles.  LDH is elevated in 60% of patients with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. LDH is not a screening test, nor is it diagnostic of melanoma, ocular adnexal lymphoma, or testicular cancer.\n\nLDH is important in melanoma staging in the setting of DISTANT metastasis.  LDH level might only be ordered after re-excision/wide excision and/or nodal evaluation indicates a higher risk of distant metastasis.  Imaging may then be performed and if distant metastasis are identified, LDH is ordered.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of LDH Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Pre systemic treatment results** \n* Record the lab value of the highest serum LDH test results documented in the medical record either before or after surgical resection of the primary tumor with or without regional lymph node dissection. \n* The LDH must be taken prior to systemic (chemo, immunotherapy, hormone), radiation therapy or surgery to a metastatic site. \n\n**Note 3:** **Related data item** \n* The same laboratory test should be used to record the related data items 3869: LDH Level and 3870: LDH Upper Limits of Normal.",
