  "description" : "Organomegaly is defined as presence of enlarged liver and/or spleen on physical examination and is part of the staging criteria for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL/SLL).\n\nFor cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 and later, all cases of CLL and SLL will require both the **Lugano classification, which is captured in the AJCC stage group data item, and the five components of the modified Rai staging system, which are captured in Site-Specific Data Items (adenopathy, anemia, lymphocytosis, organomegaly, and thrombocytopenia).**\n\nThe terms B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are different clinical presentations of the same disease, with both terms coded 9823.  \n\nTraditionally the lymphoma diagnosis was staged with the Ann Arbor staging system and it is now staged with the Lugano classification.  In North America, CLL was staged with the Rai system. \n\nSee 3955: Derived Rai stage for additional information on the related data items.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician’s statement regarding the presence of organomegaly (present or absent) takes priority. If a physician’s statement and imaging are both available and in disagreement, go with the physician’s statement\n* If a physician’s statement is not available, use the definition of adenopathy in the ***Description*** to determine if organomegaly is present or not\n\n**Note 2:** **Record information from physical exam only**\n* This data item is determined from physical exam alone. If a physical exam cannot be used to detect organomegaly due to issues linked to the patient’s obesity, a physician statement of organomegaly based on a CT scan can be used.\n* If there is no mention of the presence or absence of organomegaly (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly), code 9. \n   * **Both the liver and spleen must be evaluated** and determined to be normal to code 0. If only one is evaluated and determined to be normal, code 9.\n\n**Note 3:** **Rai Stage Criteria**\n* Rai stage is only applicable for CLL, in which the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood are involved (primary site C421 for bone marrow, see Hematopoietic Manual, Module 3: PH 5, 6). \n\n**Note 4:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record this data item based on physical exam, and physician's statement performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment)",
