  "description" : "KRAS is an important signaling intermediate in the growth receptor pathway which controls cell proliferation and survival.  KRAS is a protein with production controlled by the K-ras gene. When the K-ras gene is activated through mutation during colorectal carcinogenesis, production of KRAS continuously stimulates cell proliferation and prevents cell deaths.  Activating mutations in KRAS are an adverse prognostic factor for colorectal carcinoma and predict a poor response to monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody therapy in advanced colorectal carcinoma.\n\nKRAS is an oncogene (a gene that, when mutated or overexpressed, helps turn a normal cell into a cancer cell). Mutations of KRAS indicate that a patient may not respond to the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor drugs cetuximab (Erbitux) or panitumumab (Vectibix). ASCO recommends that Stage IV colorectal patients be tested for KRAS if anti-EGFR therapy is being considered. There are two types of KRAS genes: normal and mutated. The normal KRAS gene is also called the wild type allele; the mutated gene may be described as abnormal or having an abnormal codon (abnormal DNA sequence).",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of KRAS can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Applicable Stages**.\n* KRAS may be recorded for all stages; however, it is primarily performed for patients with metastatic disease. If information is not available, code 9\n\n**Note 3:** **Results from nodal or metastatic tissue**\n* Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used for KRAS.\n\n**Note 4:** **Timing**\n* Record the results of the KRAS from the initial workup (clinical and pathological workup).",
