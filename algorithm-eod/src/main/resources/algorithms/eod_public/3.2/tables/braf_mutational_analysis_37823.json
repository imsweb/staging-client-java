  "description" : "The BRAF oncoprotein is involved in transmitting cell growth and proliferation signals from KRAS and NRAS. The BRAF V600E mutation is associated with poorer prognosis and predicts lack of response to anti-EGFR therapies.  \n\n“BRAF V600E is a specific mutation (change) in the BRAF gene, which makes a protein that is involved in sending signals in cells and in cell growth. This BRAF gene mutation is found in colorectal cancer. It may increase the growth and spread of cancer cells. Checking for this BRAF mutation in tumor tissue may help to plan cancer treatment. BRAF (V600E) kinase inhibitor RO5185426 blocks certain proteins made by the mutated BRAF gene, which may help keep cancer cells from growing.” (NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms  https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms)\n\nNRAS is a gene which belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Studies suggest that NRAS gene mutations are often present in colorectal cancer.\n\nThe most common BRAF mutations is BRAF V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation.",
