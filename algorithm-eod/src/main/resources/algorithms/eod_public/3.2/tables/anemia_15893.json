  "description" : "Anemia is defined by a deficiency of red blood cells or of hemoglobin in the blood. In staging of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL/SLL), anemia is defined as Hgb <11.0 g/dL.\n\nFor cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 and later, all cases of CLL and SLL will require both the **Lugano classification, which is captured in the AJCC stage group data item, and the five components of the modified Rai staging system, which are captured in Site-Specific Data Items (adenopathy, anemia, lymphocytosis, organomegaly, and thrombocytopenia).**\n\nThe terms B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are different clinical presentations of the same disease, with both terms coded 9823.  \n\nTraditionally the lymphoma diagnosis was staged with the Ann Arbor staging system and it is now staged with the Lugano classification.  In North America, CLL was staged with the Rai system. \n\nSee 3955: Derived Rai stage for additional information on the related data items.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician statement of anemia or Rai Stage can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.  \n * The physician's stated Rai stage always takes priority when there is conflicting information\n\n**Note 2:** **Rai Stage Criteria**\n* Rai stage is only applicable for CLL, in which the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood are involved (primary site C421 for bone marrow, see Hematopoietic Manual, Module 3: PH 5, 6). \n\n**Note 3:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record this data item based on a blood test (CBC and differential) performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment)\n \n**Note 4:** **Values for Anemia**\n* Anemia is defined as Hgb <11.0 g/dL and is part of the staging criteria. \n* Use the cut points listed in the table regardless of the lab’s reference range\n* A lab value expressed in grams per liter (g/L) is 10 times the same value expressed in g/dL; therefore, the cut point of 11.0 g/dL is equivalent to 110 g/L",
