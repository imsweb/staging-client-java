  "description" : "Estrogen Receptor Percent Positive or Range is the percent of cells staining estrogen receptor positive by IHC.\n\nThe two most common ways to report ER and PR results are the percentage of cells with nuclear positivity and the average intensity of staining. Both the PS and IS are based on immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells.  \n\nER and PR status, the percentage of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining, may be reported as a specific number or a range if more than 10%. Intensity refers to degree of nuclear positivity (i.e., pale to dark); average intensity of staining is recorded as weak, moderate, or strong.",
