  "description" : "This data item records the physician’s statement of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nNeoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic, or radiation treatment administered prior to surgery in an attempt to shrink the tumor or destroy regional metastases.  This data item documents whether that neoadjuvant therapy was successful.  \n\nThis data item is coded based on the clinician’s statement regarding response to neoadjuvant therapy.  Do not try to interpret or infer a response based on the medical record.  As a guide for the clinician, the definitions below are from the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition. \n\nThe registrar should not use these definitions to code this field \n* Complete Response (CR) – absence of invasive carcinoma in breast and lymph nodes; must be determined by microscopic evaluation of tissues; residual in situ cancer at primary site\n* Partial Response (PR) – a decrease in T and/or N category compared to pretreatment value and no increase, using same method of evaluation as baseline value, residual tumor in lymph nodes of any size\n* No Response (NR) – no apparent change in the T or N category compared to pretreatment value, or an increase in T or N value at time of y pathological examination",
