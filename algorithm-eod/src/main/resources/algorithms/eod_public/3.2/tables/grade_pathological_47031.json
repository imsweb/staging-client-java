  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Grade Pathological must not be blank.\n\n**Note 2:** There is a preferred grading system for this schema. If the clinical grade given uses the preferred grading system and the pathological grade does not use the preferred grading system, do not record the Grade Clinical in the Grade Pathological field. Assign Grade Pathological using the applicable generic grade codes (A-D). \n* *Example:* Breast biopsy, invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2. Lumpectomy, invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 3\n   - Code Grade Clinical 2 (G2) since Nottingham is the preferred grading system\n   - Code Grade Pathological as C (nuclear Grade 3), per the Coding Guidelines for Generic Grade Categories\n\n**Note 3:** Assign the highest grade from the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 4:** If there are multiple tumors with different grades abstracted as one primary, code the highest grade.\n\n**Note 5:** There are two major grading systems used for Breast and they are based on the behavior of the primary tumor (in situ or invasive)\n**Invasive tumors**\n  * The preferred grading system for Invasive tumors is the **Nottingham grade/Nottingham Score**, also known as the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson or Bloom Richardson\n   * The **Nottingham score** is a combined histologic grade in which three components are evaluated to determine the overall grade: **tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic count**. Each of these components is assigned a value from 1 (favorable) to 3 (unfavorable) for each feature and then totaling the scores for all three categories. A combined score of 3-5 points is designated as grade 1; a combined score for 6-7 points is grade 2; a combined score of 8-9 points is grade 3\n  \n**Note 6:** If a pathology report for an invasive cancer states, “Grade 1 (or 2, 3)” and there is no further information, assume this is the Nottingham grade and assign the appropriate code. \n * If a pathology report for an invasive cancer states, “well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, low, medium, high,” use grades A-D as appropriate\n     * ***Example***: Pathology report states invasive ductal carcinoma, well differentiated. Code grade A.\n* **Do not use grades L, M, H for invasive tumors**\n  * *Exception*: Biopsy diagnosis is DCIS; Lumpectomy is invasive ductal carcinoma. The Clinical Grade would be L, M, H or 9 based on the DCIS; the Pathological Grade would be 1, 2, 3, or 9 based on the invasive ductal carcinoma. Behavior would be /3\n\n**Note 7:** **In situ tumors**\n* The preferred grading system for in situ tumors is based on a 3 grade Nuclear system, and is defined as Low (L) (Nuclear Grade 1), Intermediate (M) (Nuclear Grade 2), or High (H) (Nuclear Grade 3), or the nuclear component of the Nottingham grade\n* Documentation for these grades may be 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. This notation is documenting the nuclear component of the Nottingham grade, not the Nottingham grade (1, 2, 3)\n* If a pathologist uses a Nottingham grade (i.e., G2) for an in situ cancer, they are documenting the nuclear component of the Nottingham score. You would still assign L, M, or H as appropriate for the in situ tumor\n* **Do not use grades 1, 2, 3 for in situ tumors**\n\n**Note 8:** Grade from nodal tissue may be used **ONLY** when there was **never** any evidence of primary tumor (T0).  Grade would be coded using G1, G2, or G3, even if the grading is not strictly Nottingham, which is difficult to perform in nodal tissue. Some of the terminology may include differentiation terms without some of the morphologic features used in Nottingham (e.g., well differentiated (G1), moderately differentiated (G2), or poorly/undifferentiated (G3)).\n* *Example:* No breast tumor identified, but 2/3 axillary nodes were positive. Determined to be regional node metastasis from breast primary. Nodes were described as poorly differentiated with a high mitotic rate\n    - Code G3 based on the poorly differentiated (which is a high grade) although the terminology used is for nuclear grading \n\n**Note 9:** Use the grade from the **clinical work up** from the primary tumor in different scenarios based on behavior or surgical resection\n* **Behavior**\n  - Tumor behavior for the clinical and the pathological diagnoses are the same AND the clinical grade is the highest grade \n   - Tumor behavior for clinical diagnosis is invasive, and the tumor behavior for the pathological diagnosis is in situ\n* **Surgical Resection**\n   - Surgical resection is done of the primary tumor and there is no grade documented from the surgical resection\n    - Surgical resection is done of the primary tumor and there is no residual cancer\n* **No surgical resection**\n    - Surgical resection of the primary tumor has not been done, but there is positive microscopic confirmation of distant metastases during the clinical time frame\n\n**Note 10:** Code 9 (unknown) when\n* Grade from primary site is not documented\n* No resection of the primary site (see exception in Note 9, Surgical resection, last bullet)\n* Neo-adjuvant therapy is followed by a resection (see Grade Post Therapy Path (yp))\n* Grade checked “not applicable” on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available\n* Clinical case only (see Grade Clinical)\n* There is only one grade available and it cannot be determined if it is clinical, pathological, post therapy clinical or post therapy pathological\n\n**Note 11:** If you are assigning an AJCC Staging System stage group\n* Grade is required to assign stage group\n* Codes A-D are treated as an unknown grade when assigning AJCC stage group \n* An unknown grade may result in an unknown stage group",
