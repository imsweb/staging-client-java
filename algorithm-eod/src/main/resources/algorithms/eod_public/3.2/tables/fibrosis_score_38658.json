  "description" : "Fibrosis Score (Ishak Score), the degree of fibrosis of the liver based on pathological examination, is a prognostic factor for liver cancer.\n\nThe Fibrosis Score is based on degree of parenchymal fibrosis or cirrhosis of the nontumorous liver as defined in the surgical pathology report. Multiple fibrosis scoring systems have been described for use in pathological evaluation of liver disease.  \n* Ishak system uses a scale of 0-6 with 6 indicating cirrhosis. \n   * Recommended by AJCC and CAP\n* Batts-Ludwig system uses a score of 0-4, with a score of 3 defined as fibrous septa with architectural distortion but no obvious cirrhosis, and a score of 4 defined as cirrhosis\n  * Used most commonly by US pathologists\n* METAVIR uses scores of F0-F4\n   * Used mostly in Europe",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of fibrosis score can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n  * Code 7 when the physician statement of fibrosis score is not based on histologic examination of the liver\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for collecting**\n* Record the results based on information collected during the initial work-up through the first course surgery, in the absence of neoadjuvant treatment. If multiple histologic assessments of the liver (biopsies or resections) are taken and have conflicting scores, record the highest score. \n  * Information collected after the start of **neoadjuvant treatment** or primary systemic or radiation therapy **may not be used** to code this data item\n\n**Note 3:** **FIB Scoring** \n* FIB-4 is **NOT** a pathological fibrosis score of 4, it is a scoring method using the patient's age and relevant lab values to calculate a score. The medical record may show something like \"FIB-4 = 3.52.\" \n* Do not code FIB-4 values in this data item.\n\n**Note 4:** **Ishak score (classified by AJCC)** \n* F0: None to moderate fibrosis (Ishak Score 0-4) \n* F1: Cirrhosis/severe fibrosis (Ishak Score 5-6)\n* **Note:** These are not the same thing as the METAVIR score F0 or F1",
