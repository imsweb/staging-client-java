  "description" : "Sarcomatoid features: present or absent and percentage refers to the observation of sheets and fascicles of malignant spindle cells in a kidney tumor which can occur across all histologic subtypes. The percentage of sarcomatoid component has been shown to correlate with cancer-specific mortality.  \n\nThe presence of sarcomatoid or spindle cell features in a kidney tumor is a strong adverse prognostic factor. There is a specific ICD-O morphology code for renal cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid or spindle cell (8318/3), but this data item documents any sarcomatoid or spindle cell features in any renal cell cancer. \n* Note: This data item applies to carcinomas only; rare sarcomas of the kidney should not be coded in this field\n* Code the percentage of sarcomatoid features documented anywhere in the pathology report",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Staging** \n* Physician statement of Sarcomatoid Features (spindle cell features) can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for coding** \n* Surgical resection of primary site must be done\n   * If no surgical resection of primary site, code unknown (code 9)\n* Do not use imaging findings to code this data item.\n\n**Note 3:** **Sarcomatoid morphology/features** \n* Sarcomatoid morphology may be manifested by any renal cell carcinoma. The presence of sarcomatoid component in a renal cell carcinoma may be prognostically important. \n\n* Sarcomatoid features is mostly seen with renal cell carcinoma (all variants); however, if itâ€™s seen with other carcinoma  histologies, it can be coded.",
