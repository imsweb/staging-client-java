  "description" : "Thrombocytopenia is defined by a deficiency of platelets in the blood. In staging of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL/SLL), thrombocytopenia is defined as Platelets (Plt) < 100,000/μL.\n\nFor cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 and later, all cases of CLL and SLL will require both the **Lugano classification, which is captured in the AJCC stage group data item, and the five components of the modified Rai staging system, which are captured in Site-Specific Data Items (adenopathy, anemia, lymphocytosis, organomegaly, and thrombocytopenia).**\n\nThe terms B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are different clinical presentations of the same disease, with both terms coded 9823.  \n\nTraditionally the lymphoma diagnosis was staged with the Ann Arbor staging system and it is now staged with the Lugano classification.  In North America, CLL was staged with the Rai system. \n\nSee 3955: Derived Rai stage for additional information on the related data items.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician statement of thrombocytopenia or Rai Stage can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.  \n * The physician's stated Rai stage always takes priority when there is conflicting information\n\n**Note 2:** **Rai Stage Criteria**\n* Rai stage is only applicable for CLL, in which the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood are involved (primary site C421 for bone marrow, see Hematopoietic Manual, Module 3: PH 5, 6). \n\n**Note 3:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record this data item based on a blood test (CBC and differential) performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment)\n  * Do not use results from a urine test\n\n**Note 4:** **Values for Thrombocytopenia**\n* Thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets (Plt) <100,000/μL. This is part of the Modified Rai Staging System and not included as part of the AJCC Lugano staging. \n* Use the cut points listed in the table regardless of the lab’s reference range\n* For cases that document platelet counts in SI (Systeme Internationale) units as any of 10*9/L, 10^9/L, or 10E9/L, the cut point of 100,000 cells/µL is equivalent to (100 cells x 10*9/L), (100 cells x 10^9/L, or (100 cells x 10E9/L)",
