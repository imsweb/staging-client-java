  "description" : "Estrogen Receptor Total Allred Score is based on the percentage of cells that stain positive by IHC for estrogen receptor (ER) and the intensity of that staining.\n\nThe Allred Score is a method of quantifying ER and PR using both intensity and percentage of positive cells.  The Allred Score is calculated by adding the Proportion Score and the Intensity Score, as defined in the tables below.\n\nThe Allred score combines the percentage of positive cells (proportion score) and the intensity score of the reaction product in most of the carcinoma.  The 2 scores are added together for a final score with 8 possible values (00-08). \n\nPositive cells = 0; Proportion score = 0\nPositive cells = <1; Proportion score = 1\nPositive cells = 1 to 10; Proportion score = 2\nPositive cells = 11 to 33; Proportion score = 3\nPositive cells = 34 to 66; Proportion score = 4\nPositive cells = 67 or greater; Proportion score = 5\n\nIntensity = None; Intensity Score = 0\nIntensity = Weak; Intensity Score = 1\nIntensity = Intermediate/Moderate; Intensity Score = 2\nIntensity = Strong; Intensity Score = 3",
