  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Cortex of the bone**\n* The cortex of a bone is the dense outer shell that provides strength to the bone; the spongy center of a bone is the cancellous portion. \n* The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.\n\n**Note 2:** **Number of pelvic segments** \n* The number of pelvic segments involved by the primary tumor determines the appropriate EOD Primary Tumor (codes 100 through 550). The four pelvic segments used in these codes are: \n  * Acetabulum\n  * Iliac wing\n  * Pubic ramus/Symphysis/Ischium\n  * Sacrum",
