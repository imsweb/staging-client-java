  "description" : "HIV status refers to infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  AIDS is associated with increased risk of developing some lymphomas.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causal agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Certain types of cancer are associated with HIV and AIDS, including Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and primary central nervous system lymphoma. These diseases in patients with HIV or AIDS have different clinical and pathological features from the same diseases when they occur in the general population, such as more extranodal involvement. This data item documents whether the patient has HIV infection or AIDS at the time of diagnosis",
