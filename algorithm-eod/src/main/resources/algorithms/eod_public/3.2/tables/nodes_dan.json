Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **Unnamed nodes** \n* **For Colon and Rectum ONLY**, any unnamed nodes that are removed with a colon or rectal resection are presumed to be regional pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes and are included in the EOD Regional Nodes code 300 (pericolic for sites C180 - C189, C199 and perirectal for sites C199 or C209). \n* This site-specific instruction applies only to colon and rectum tumors and was verified with subject matter experts.\n\n**Note 3:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.  \n* **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only code (300) is used when\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, includes\n    * FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy or lymph node excision done during the clinical work up **AND/OR**\n    * Lymph node dissection performed\n  * Pathological code 300 takes priority over codes 350-600, 800\n\n* **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (350-600) are used when the **only** information on nodal involvement is based on **physical exam or imaging** \n   * These codes are specifically for when there is no **microscopic confirmation** of regional lymph nodes (*Regional Nodes Positive = 98, 99*)\n   * **Note:** Use code 300 if *Regional Nodes Positive is 01-90, 95*\n\n* Remaining codes (no designation of **CLINICAL** or **PATHOLOGICAL** only assessment) can be used based on clinical and/or pathological information\n  * **Code 000** is used when there is no evidence of regional lymph nodes clinically **OR** lymph nodes are negative pathologically (*Regional Nodes Positive = 00, 98*)\n  * **Code 800** is used when there are positive nodes (clinical or pathological), but the specific lymph nodes or number of positive nodes is unknown (*Regional Nodes Positive = 97*) \n  * **Code 999** is used when the lymph node status is unknown and *Regional Nodes Positive = 99*\n\n**Note 4:** **Tumor Deposits** \n* Code 200 is defined as **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only. This is used when\n* Primary tumor or site surgically resected with\n  * Any positive microscopic examination of tumor deposits WITHOUT positive lymph nodes\n    * If there are also positive lymph nodes, code 300",
