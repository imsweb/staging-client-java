  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Pleural and pericardial effusions**\n* Most pleural and pericardial effusions with lung cancer are due to tumor\n* In a few patients, however, multiple cytopathological examinations of pleural and/or pericardial fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is non-bloody and is not an exudate. Where these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. \n  * Code 00 in the absence of any other metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:** **Extrathoracic metastasis**\n* Organs \n  * Abdominal organs\n  * Adjacent rib (noncontiguous involvement only) (see *EOD Primary Tumor* for contiguous involvement)\n  * Skin of chest \n  * Separate lesion in chest wall or diaphragm\n\n* Distant lymph node(s)\n  - Cervical \n  - Distant lymph node(s), NOS\n\n* Carcinomatosis \n* Distant metastasis WITH or WITHOUT distant lymph node(s)",
