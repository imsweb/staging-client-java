  "description" : "HER2 IHC Summary is the summary score for HER2 testing by IHC.\n\nThe simplest test used is the IHC (immunohistochemistry). An immunohistochemistry (IHC) test identifies the protein expressed by the gene (ERBB2), and an in-situ hybridization (ISH) test identifies the number of copies of the gene (ERBB2) itself. If the IHC test is borderline or indeterminate, an ISH (in situ hybridization) test may be performed. \n\nReporting Results of HER2 Testing by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n* Negative (Score 0): No staining observed or incomplete, faint/barely perceptible membrane staining in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells\n* Negative (Score 1+): Incomplete, faint/barely perceptible membrane staining in >10% of invasive tumor cells\n* Equivocal (Score 2+): Incomplete and/or weak to moderate circumferential membrane staining in >10% of invasive tumor cells or complete, intense, circumferential membrane staining in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells\n* Positive (Score 3+): Complete, intense, circumferential membrane staining in >10% of invasive tumor cells",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This SSDI is no longer required by any of the standard setters starting with 2021 diagnoses. \n* For cases diagnosed 2021+, this SSDI may be left blank\n\n**Note 2:** Physician statement of HER2 IHC Summary can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** The HER2 IHC test performed on the primary breast tissue is to be recorded in this data item. \n\n**Note 4:** A 2+ (equivocal) finding by IHC should result in additional testing with ISH to determine gene copy number.\n\n**Note 5:** Do not use results from the following tests to record HER2 \n  * MammaPrint\n  * EndoPredict\n  * PAM 50 (Prosigna)\n  * Any other test that records HER2",
