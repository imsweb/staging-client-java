  "description" : "Chromosome 19q: Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) refers to the loss of genetic material normally found on the long arm of one of the patient's two copies of chromosome 19.  Codeletion of Chromosome 1p and 19q is a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive marker for gliomas and is strongly associated with the oligodendroglioma phenotype.\n\nLoss of Heterozygosity Chromosome 1 p and Chromosome 19q are two genetic tests that are frequently done at the same time and reported together. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a chromosome means that genetic material normally found in a specific area of a chromosome is missing. In other words, this is damage to the chromosome that results in failure of tumor suppression, which in turn may cause the development or progression of a malignancy. For 1p LOH, the specific chromosomal defect is on the short arm (p) of chromosome 1. For 19q LOH, the specific chromosomal defect is on the long arm (q) of chromosome 19.\n\nNormal cells have two complete copies of each chromosome, a state called heterozygosity. The loss of this section of the chromosome is associated with improved outcome. It can be used to aid diagnosis and to make treatment decisions because sensitivity to chemotherapy agents, such as lomustine, procarbazine, and vincristine, is increased with either 1p or 19q LOH. Special molecular diagnostic (polymerase chain reaction or gene amplification) tests look for missing genetic material. LOH for chromosome 1p and 19q is tested primarily for oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. It is infrequently tested for other gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme.",
