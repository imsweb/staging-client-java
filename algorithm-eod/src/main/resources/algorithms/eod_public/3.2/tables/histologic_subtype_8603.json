The peritoneal adenomucinous/low grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei is describing metastatic disease and not the histology\n\n**2.** Appendix: Low grade (well diff) appendiceal adenocarcinoma\n   * **Code 0**: This is an adenocarcinoma (8140/3), the low grade (well diff) is describing the grade and not the histology\n\n**3.** Appendix, appendectomy: Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) with focal high grade mucinous neoplasm.\n   * **Code 1**: Based on the Solid Tumor Rules, the “focal” would be ignored and this would be a LAMN.\n\n**4.** Appendectomy: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix\n   * **Code 3**: Mucinous adenocarcinoma is the preferred terminology for histology code 8480/3. Since there is no mention of “low grade” or “high grade”, this would not be LAMN or HAMN\n\n**5.** Appendix: Mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma\n   * **Code 3**: Colloid adenocarcinoma is an alternate name for 8480/3",
  "rationale" : "Due to the different natures of these histologies, there is interest in tracking these different types of tumors. With the current histology codes, a distinction cannot be made. A histology subtype data item is needed."
