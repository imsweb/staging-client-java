Do not include clinical findings in this field.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician statement of pathologically confirmed invasion of the tumor beyond the fibrous capsule (invasion beyond capsule) can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Relevance to Staging**\n* Information about invasion beyond the capsule is collected in primary tumor as an element in anatomic staging. It is also collected in this field as it may have an independent effect on prognosis. \n\n**Note 3:** **Perinephric/sinus fat invasion**\n* Should be confirmed microscopically and is invasion into fat by tumor cells, with or without desmoplastic reaction, and vascular invasion into perinephric/sinus soft tissue.\n   * Synonyms include renal sinus fat, medial invasion\n\n* **Do not code invasion of renal hilum in this data item.** \n   * Invasion of the renal hilum is invasion of vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and/or ureter before they enter the kidney parenchyma. If the only information you have is that the renal hilum is involved, code to 9 (unknown)",
