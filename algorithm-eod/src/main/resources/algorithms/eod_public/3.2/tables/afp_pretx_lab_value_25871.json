  "description" : "AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Pretreatment Lab Value is a nonspecific serum protein that generally is elevated in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  This data item pertains to the pre-treatment lab value.\n\nA protein normally produced by a fetus. Alpha fetoprotein levels are usually undetectable in the blood of healthy adult men or women (who are not pregnant). An elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein suggests the presence of either a primary liver cancer or germ cell tumor.\n\nThere are 2 related data items that record information on CEA for Colon and Rectum.\n* 3810: AFP Pretreatment Lab Value\n* 3809: AFP Pretreatment Interpretation",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician statement of AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Pretreatment Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record the lab value of the highest AFP test result documented in the medical record prior to treatment. The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Related data item**\n* The same laboratory test should be used to record information in the related data item 3810: AFP Pretreatment Lab Value",
