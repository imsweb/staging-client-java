  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Cortex of the bone**\n* The cortex of a bone is the dense outer shell that provides strength to the bone; the spongy center of a bone is the cancellous portion.  \n* The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.\n\n**Note 2:** **Vertebral segments**\n* The number of vertebral segments involved by the primary tumor determines the appropriate EOD Primary Tumor (codes 100 through 400). The five vertebral segments used in these codes are:\n  * Body (left)\n  * Body (right)\n  * Pedicle (left)\n  * Pedicle (right)\n  * Posterior element",
