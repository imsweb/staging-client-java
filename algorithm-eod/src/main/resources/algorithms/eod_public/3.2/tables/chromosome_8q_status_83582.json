  "description" : "Chromosome 8q Status refers to gain in Chromosome 8q, which is a prognostic factor for uveal melanoma.\n\nThe loss of an entire copy of chromosome 8, which occurs in about half of patients, is the most important indicator of poor prognosis for the uveal melanomas, particularly melanoma of the choroids and ciliary body. A variety of sophisticated tests can be used to determine chromosome 8 status \n* Karyotyping\n* Fluorescence in situ hybridization\n* Comparative genomic hybridization\n* DNA polymorphism analysis (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism, microsatellite).\n* Multiplex ligation probe amplification\n\nMonosomy 3, especially if combined with a frequently coexisting gain in chromosome 8q, is independently associated with metastatic risk. Chromosome 3 and 8 statuses may be determined with karyotyping or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).",
