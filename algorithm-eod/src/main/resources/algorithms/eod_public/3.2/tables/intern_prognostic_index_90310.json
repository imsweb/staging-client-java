  "description" : "The NCCN International Prognostic Index (IPI) (previously only “IPI”) is used to define risk groups for specific lymphomas using a 0-8 score range, based on age, stage, number of extranodal sites of involvement, patient’s performance status and LDH level.\n\nThe NCCN International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been developed for lymphomas and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors:\n* Age greater than or equal to 60 years \n* Serum LDH greater than normal\n* Performance status 2-4 \n* Stage III or IV\n* Extranodal involvement greater than 1 site",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of NCCN IPI **must** be used to code this data item. \n  * Do not calculate points or assign risk. Only record points or risk if a physician has documented them\n  * Use points over risk if both are available\n\n**Note 2:** **NCCN is applicable for non-Hodgkin lymphomas only.**\n* If you have a score for Hodgkin lymphomas (IPS), do not record that information here. Code X9.\n\n**Note 3:** **NCCN and Rai Stage** \n* A low, intermediate or high risk associated with a Rai Stage is not recorded in this data item.",
