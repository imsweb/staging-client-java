  "description" : "Extranodal extension is defined as “the extension of a nodal metastasis through the lymph node capsule into adjacent tissue” and is a prognostic factor for most head and neck tumors. This data item pertains to clinical extension.\n\nThe presence of extranodal extension (ENE) from regional lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in some cancers because these patients are rarely cured without some type of systemic chemotherapy or radiation. \n\nClinical ENE is described in the AJCC Head and Neck Staging System as \"Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature, tethering to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction)\"\n* The terms 'fixed' or 'matted' are used to describe lymph nodes\n\nThis data item for ENE detected clinically.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physican Statement** \n* Physician statement of extranodal extension (ENE) clinically or physician clinical stage indicating the absence or presence of ENE can be used to code this data item when no other information is available \n* Physical exam alone is sufficient to determine Clinical ENE\n\n**Note 2:** **Clinical assessment criteria** \n* The assessment of ENE must be based on evidence acquired prior to definitive surgery of the primary site, chemotherapy, radiation, or other type of treatment, i.e., the clinical timeframe for staging. \n* The assessment for ENE in **addition to physical examination** may include imaging, biopsy of the regional lymph node, and/or biopsy of tissues surrounding the regional lymph node\n* Fixed or matted nodes are clinical indications of ENE\n* Imaging **alone** is not enough to determine or exclude ENE\n* Note that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.",
