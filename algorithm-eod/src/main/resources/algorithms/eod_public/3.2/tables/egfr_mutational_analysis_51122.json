  "description" : "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational analysis is performed for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to identify patients with certain activating mutations in the EGFR gene which are sensitive to tyrosine kinase Inhibitors.\n\n“EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a protein found on certain types of cells that binds to a substance called epidermal growth factor. The EGFR protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival. Sometimes, mutations (changes) in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher-than-normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly.” (NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms  https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms)\n\nThe presence of Exon 20 EGFR activating mutations are associated with a resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibits, such as erlotinib, afatinib, and gefitinib. There is limited data available on response for some of the other uncommon EGFR mutations (other than Exon 20). (CAP Cancer Protocol).\n\nThe most common EGFR mutations are \n * Exon 18 Gly719\n * Exon 19 deletion\n * Exon 20 insertion\n * Exon 20 Thr790Met\n * Exon 21 Leu858Arg",

If information is not available, code 9.\n\n**Note 4:** **Neoadjuvant Therapy**\n* Record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no EGFR results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.",
