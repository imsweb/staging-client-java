  "description" : "Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS is a numeric score of a genomic test to predict the likelihood of distant recurrence of invasive breast cancer based on the assessment of 21 genes.\n\nThe Oncotype DX DCIS score is a genomic test that estimates the likelihood of local recurrence (DCIS or invasive) for a patient with DCIS.  The results may be used clinically to evaluate benefits of radiation therapy following surgery.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician statement**\n* Physician statement of Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score-DCIS can be used to code this data item when no other is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Type of Test**\n* Record only the results of an Oncotype Dx-DCIS recurrence score in this data item. If some other test is used for scoring, assign code XX9.\n\n**Note 3:** **Multiple tests, multiple results**\n* In cases where Oncotype Dx-DCIS is reported on more than one in situ breast tumor specimen, record the highest value.\n\n**Note 4:** **Related data item** \n* Code this data item using the same report used to record the related data item 3905: Oncotype Dx Risk Level-DCIS.",
