  "description" : "Heritable trait pertains to evidence that a tumor is associated with a heritable mutation. In retinoblastoma, the heritable trait is a germline mutation in the RB1 gene, which is associated with bilateral disease, family history of retinoblastoma, presence of concomitant CNS midline embryonic tumor (commonly in pineal region), or retinoblastoma with an intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (i.e., trilateral retinoblastoma). Children with any of these features may be assigned the H1 status without molecular testing.  High quality molecular testing for RB1 mutation is required to determine the presence or absence of RB1 mutation for children without clinical features of a heritable mutation.\n\nHeritable disease (trait) is defined by the presence of a germline mutation of the RB1 gene. This germline mutation may have been inherited from an affected progenitor (25% of cases) or may have occurred in a germ cell before conception or in utero during early embryogenesis in patients with sporadic disease (75% of cases). The presence of positive family history or bilateral or multifocal disease is suggestive of heritable disease. \n\nHeritable retinoblastoma may manifest as unilateral or bilateral disease. The penetrance of the RB1 mutation (laterality, age at diagnosis, and number of tumors) is probably dependent on concurrent genetic modifiers such as MDM2 and MDM4 polymorphisms. All children with bilateral disease and approximately 15% of patients with unilateral disease are presumed to have the heritable form, even though only 25% have an affected parent.\n\nIn heritable retinoblastoma, tumors tend to be diagnosed at a younger age than in the nonheritable form of the disease. Unilateral retinoblastoma in children younger than 1 year raises concern for heritable disease, whereas older children with a unilateral tumor are more likely to have the nonheritable form of the disease.\n\nChildren with a germline RB1 mutation may continue to develop new tumors for a few years after diagnosis and treatment; for this reason, they need to be examined frequently. It is common practice for examinations to occur every 2 to 4 months for at least 28 months. The interval between exams is based on the stability of the disease and age of the child (i.e., less frequent visits as the child ages).\n\nPatients with heritable retinoblastoma are also at a greater risk for subsequent neoplasms.\n\nHeritable trait is required for prognostic stage grouping in the AJCC Staging System Retinoblastoma.  It is a new data item for cases diagnosed 1/1/2018+.",
