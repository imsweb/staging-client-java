  "description" : "Circumferential or Radial Resection Margin, the distance in millimeters between the leading edge of the tumor and the surgically dissected margin as recorded on the pathology report, is a prognostic indicator for colon and rectal cancer.  This may also be referred to as the Radial Resection Margin or surgical clearance.\n\nThe CRM, also referred to as the radial margin or the mesenteric resection margin, is the measurement of the distance from the deepest invasion of the tumor to the margin of resection in the retroperitoneum or mesentery. In other words, the CRM is the width of the surgical margin at the deepest part of the tumor in an area of the large intestine or rectum without serosa (non-peritonealized rectum below the peritoneal reflection) or only partly covered by serosa (upper rectum, posterior aspects of ascending and descending colon).\n\nFor segments of the colon completely encased by peritoneum, the mesenteric resection margin is the only relevant circumferential margin.\n\nThe CRM is not the same as the distance to the proximal and distal margins of the colon specimen. For rectal cancers, the circumferential resection margin is the most important predictor of local-regional recurrence.\n\nPer the AJCC Staging System Colon and Rectum, \"the CRM is the distance in millimeters between the deepest point of tumor invasion in the primary cancer and the margin of resection in the retroperitoneum or mesentery.\"",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of Circumferential or Radial Resection Margin can be used to code this data item when no other information is available, provided the criteria for evaluation has been met *(see Note 2)*.\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for evaluating CRM**\n* A surgical resection must be done to evaluate tumor deposits\n* See *Coding Guidelines #3 and #4* for further information\n\n**Note 3:** **Exact measurements versus XX codes**\n* An exact measurement takes precedence over codes 0.0 and those beginning with XX**. Exact measurement also takes priority even if the pathologist states the margin is positive.\n  * ***Example:*** CRM stated as 0.3 mm in Final Diagnosis and Synoptic states: Circumferential (Radial) Margin Interpreted as involved by invasive carcinoma (tumor less than 1mm from margin).\n      * Code the 0.3 mm instead of 0.0 (margin involved with tumor).    Code 0.0 is for positive margins, or margin is less than 0.1 mm.",

  "coding_guidelines" : "The following guidelines were developed for the coding of surgery codes in relation to CRM.
