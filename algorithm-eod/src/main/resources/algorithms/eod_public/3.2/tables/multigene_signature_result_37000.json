  "description" : "Multigene signatures or classifiers are assays of a panel of genes from a tumor specimen, intended to provide a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of response to chemotherapy and to evaluate prognosis or the likelihood of future metastasis. This data item identifies the multigene signature result.  Oncotype Dx is coded elsewhere.",
