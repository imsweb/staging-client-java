  "description" : "Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2, JAK 2) is a gene mutation that increases susceptibility to several myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Testing for the JAK2 mutation is done on whole blood. Nearly all people with polycythemia vera, and about half of those with primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia, have the mutation.  JAK2 analysis continues to increase in use for hematopoietic neoplasms.\n\nJAK2, a gene found in all humans, is involved in the development of blood cells. If JAK2 has mutated, the person is more susceptible to develop a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). The JAK2 mutation, which is acquired rather than inherited, is found in as many as 90% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), about half of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), and slightly fewer patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and other terms). JAK2 is used by clinicians to help classify MPDs. The most common histologies for which JAK-2 is tested are those listed above. Registrars can use JAK2 information to help determine whether the MPD is reportable. JAK2 positivity indicates a malignant (clonal, irreversible) reportable disease, but is not diagnostic of a specific MPD. Additional tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy, are necessary to determine the specific MPD histology. As the use of JAK2 increases and is investigated for other hematopoietic histologies, it also has future potential for development of targeted therapeutics for the MPDs.\n\nThe principal JAK2 test looks for a change (mutation) in an amino acid at a specific place on the JAK2 gene called V617F. If the V617F test is negative, other JAK2 mutation tests, such as those in exon 12 or 13 may be ordered to investigate a possible diagnosis of polycythemia vera. (An exon is a segment of a gene that contains instructions for making a protein.)",
