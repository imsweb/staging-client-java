  "description" : "Prostate cancers are graded using Gleason score or pattern.  This data item represents the Gleason primary and secondary patterns from a radical prostatectomy or autopsy.  \n\nThe pathologist determines the Gleason patterns by looking at the prostate tissue under the microscope. The pathologist assigns a grade to the most predominant pattern (largest surface area of involvement, more than 50% of tissue) and a grade for the secondary pattern (second most predominant) based on published Gleason criteria. When a patient undergoes radical prostatectomy, the pathologist may look for a third or tertiary pattern in the specimen. When Gleason pattern 5 is present as a tertiary pattern, its presence should be indicated in the pathology report, as a high Gleason pattern appears to be an indicator for worse outcome (shortened time to recurrence). Studies indicate that a Gleason score 7, with tertiary pattern 5, is associated with a worse prognosis than without tertiary pattern 5 and is similar to the prognosis for Gleason score 8 â€“ 10.   \n* For example, in a specimen where the primary Gleason pattern is 3, the secondary is 4 and there is less than 5% Gleason 5, the report should indicate a Gleason score of 7 (3+4) with tertiary Gleason pattern 5. Gleason grades (patterns) range from 1 (small, uniform gland) to 5 (lack of glands, sheets of cells.)\n\nFor the Gleason Patterns data items, there is a long list of codes and definitions in the table, but it may be easier to assign a value if you understand the structure of the code.  This is a two-digit field. \n* First digit is the Gleason primary pattern value\n* Second digit is the Gleason secondary pattern value\n\nThe Gleason system for grading prostate cancer is the one recommended by the AJCC and College of American Pathologists.  The following related data items are used to collect information on Gleason.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of Gleason Patterns Pathological can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Procedures** \n* Code the Gleason primary and secondary patterns from a radical prostatectomy or autopsy only in this field. Unlike Grade Group Pathological, do not include patterns from tissues taken prior to prostatectomy.\n  * Code results from a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) or simple prostatectomy in Gleason Patterns Clinical\n\n**Note 3:** **Gleason Grading** \n* Usually, prostate cancers are graded using Gleason score or pattern. Gleason grading for prostate primaries is based on a 5-component system (5 histologic patterns). Prostatic cancer generally shows two main histologic patterns. The primary pattern, the pattern occupying greater than 50% of the cancer, is usually indicated by the first number of the Gleason grade, and the secondary pattern is usually indicated by the second number.  These two numbers are added together to create a pattern score.  \n* If there are two numbers, assume that they refer to two patterns (the first number being the primary pattern and the second number the secondary pattern), and sum them to obtain the score.\n* If only one number is given, and it is less than or equal to 5, assume that it describes a pattern (since scores of 5 or less would reflect Primary or Secondary Pattern Scores of 1 or 2). Code the number as the primary pattern and code the secondary pattern as Unknown. \n* * For ***example,*** if only one number is given, and it is a 3, code \"39\" for Gleason Patterns and \"X9\" for Gleason Score.\n* If only one number is given, and it is greater than 5, assume that it is a score. \n* * For ***example,*** if only one number is given, and it is a 7, code \"X6\" for Gleason Patterns and \"07\" for Gleason Score. \n* If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score. \n* * For ***example,*** if the pathology report says Gleason 7/10, code \"07' for Gleason Score and \"X6\" for Gleason Patterns. \n\n**Note 4:** **Different patterns** \n* If different patterns are documented on multiple specimens, code the pattern that reflects the highest or most aggressive score regardless of if the pathologist provides an overall pattern in a final summary. If different patterns equal the same high score, give priority to the highest primary pattern and then the highest secondary pattern.\n\n**Note 5:** **Tertiary pattern** \n* If a tertiary pattern is documented on prostatectomy or autopsy, code in the related data item 3842: Gleason Tertiary Pattern.\n\n**Note 6:** **Neoadjuvant therapy** \n* Code X9 when neoadjuvant therapy was given\n\n**Note 7:** **Active surveillance, then Radical Prostatectomy**\n* Code X9 when first course of treatment is active surveillance, but a radical prostatectomy is done at a later date due to disease progression or the patient changed their mind\n\n**Note 8:** **Related data item** \n* The pathological score is recorded in the related data item 3841: Gleason Score Pathological.",
