  "description" : "CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) Pretreatment Interpretation refers to the interpretation of the CEA value prior to treatment.  CEA is a nonspecific tumor marker that has prognostic significance for colon and rectum cancer.\n\nCEA is\n**1).** A protein molecule found in many different cells of the body but associated with certain tumors and with the developing fetus.  \n**2).** CEA is used as a tumor marker especially for gastrointestinal cancers, as colorectal cancer is the most frequent cause for an increased/elevated CEA.  \n**3).** CEA is also elevated by biliary obstruction, alcoholic hepatitis, and heavy smoking.   \n**4).** CEA level is most frequently tested on blood serum, but it may be tested in body fluids and/or biopsy tissue.  \n**5).** An abnormally high CEA level prior to tumor resection is expected to fall following successful removal of the cancer.  \n**6).** An increasing value indicates possible recurrence.\n\nThere are 2 related data items that record information on CEA for Colon and Rectum.\n* 3820: CEA Pretreatment Lab Value\n* 3819: CEA Pretreatment Interpretation",
