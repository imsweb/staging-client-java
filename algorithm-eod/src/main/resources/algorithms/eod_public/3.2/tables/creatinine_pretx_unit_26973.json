  "description" : "Creatinine Pretreatment Unit of Measure identifies the unit of measure for the creatinine value measured in blood or serum prior to treatment. Creatinine is commonly measured in units of Milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) in the United States and Micromoles/liter (umol/L) in Canada and Europe.\n\nThere are two methods of describing creatinine levels in the blood, weight in grams (milligrams per deciliter), usually used in the US, and molecular count in moles (micromoles per liter) in Canada. Conversion: 1 mg/dL = 17.1 mol/L. Code the unit of measure used by the facility laboratory. \n\nThere are two related data items that record information on Creatinine. \n* 3824: Creatinine Pretreatment Lab Value.\n* 3825: Creatinine Pretreatment Unit of Measure",

Use the highest value available\n* Record the blood or serum creatinine value for this data item\n  * Do not use urine results to code this data item. \n\n**Note 3:** **Measurement definitions** \n* There are two main methods of describing concentrations: by weight, and by molecular count.\n* Weights are recorded in grams, and molecular counts are recorded in moles.\n* Milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) is the unit of measure commonly used in the United States.\n* Micromoles/liter (umol/L) is the designated Systeme International (SI) unit of measure commonly used in Canada and Europe.\nâ€¢\t1 mg/dL of bilirubin is 17.1 umol/L.\n\n**Note 4:** **Related data item**\n* The same laboratory test should be used to record information in the related data item data item 3824: Creatinine Pretreatment Lab Value.",
