  "description" : "Ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement pertains to direct extension of the tumor into the ipsilateral adrenal gland (continuous) or ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement by a separate nodule (discontiguous).\n\nThe adrenal gland is contained within Gerota’s fascia and is contiguous with the kidney, but it has its own lymphatic and vascular drainage systems. Involvement of the ipsilateral (same side) adrenal gland by kidney tumor—an adverse prognostic indicator—may be by direct extension (contiguous) or hematogenous (through the bloodstream; discontiguous).  Do not include clinical findings in this field.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of Ipsilateral Adrenal Gland (suprarenal gland, same side [ipsilateral]) Involvement can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Relevance to Staging** \n* Information about contiguous ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement is collected in primary tumor, and discontiguous ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement is collected in distant metastasis, as elements in anatomic staging. This information is also collected in this field as it may have an independent effect on prognosis.",
