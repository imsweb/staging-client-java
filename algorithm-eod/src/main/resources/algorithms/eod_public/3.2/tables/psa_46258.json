  "description" : "PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland and is elevated in patients with prostate cancer. This data item pertains to PSA lab value.\n\nSerum PSA is the most sensitive tumor marker for monitoring individuals with prostate cancer, including progression of disease and response to therapy.  Although originally not intended to be a screening test, this relatively simple blood test has become a very common method of detecting new prostate cancer in its earliest stages.  PSA can be totally negative when prostate cancer is found on digital rectal exam.  In such cases, PSA will not be helpful in monitoring for recurrence. \n* ***Note:*** Serum PSA is not the same as free PSA or precursor PSA—do not record values from either of these tests in this field.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) pre-diagnosis can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Staging related** \n* PSA is a prognostic factor required for AJCC staging.  It affects the stage group in most cases.\n\n**Note 3:** **PSA Adjustment** \n* A discrepancy between the PSA documented in the lab report and the PSA documented by the clinician may arise due to the clinician's adjusting the PSA value. Certain medications for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) decrease the PSA. \n  * If there is documentation by a clinician within the medical record of an adjusted PSA value, record the adjusted value. \n  * The registrar does not adjust the PSA value based on BPH medication use. \n  * If there is no documentation by a clinician within the medical record of an adjusted PSA value, record the PSA value provided. \n  * The fact that an adjusted PSA value is being recorded should be documented in the Dx Proc - Lab Tests text field (NAACCR Item # 2550).",
