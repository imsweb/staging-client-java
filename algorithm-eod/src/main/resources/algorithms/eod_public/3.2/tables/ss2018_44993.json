If you have one of these cases for 2018-2022, then this is the appropriate chapter.

It is always coded to 7 for systemic involvement.\n\n**Note 5:** **Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma** \n* Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (9671) and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (9761) are now collected with the plasma cell disorders. \n* These are systemic diseases and should always be coded 7.",
