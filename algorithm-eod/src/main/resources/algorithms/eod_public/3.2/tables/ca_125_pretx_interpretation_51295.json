  "description" : "Carbohydrate Antigen 125 (CA-125)/CA-125 II is a tumor marker that is useful for following the response to therapy in patients with ovarian cancer, who may have elevated levels of this marker.\n\nCA-125/CA-125 II is a tumor marker that is not specific to ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer but is useful to monitor for success of treatment and recurrence.  Because it can be elevated in many diseases affecting the peritoneal lining of the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not a screening test for women who have no history of cancer.  Any value over 35 is highly linked with cancer and about 80% of ovarian cancers show an elevated CA-125/CA-125 II.  However, a result in the normal range does not rule out cancer. Values up to 65 U/ml may be considered borderline, and values over 200 are unlikely to be due to a benign condition.  CA-125/CA-125 II monitors for success of treatment and recurrence.  After obtaining a baseline value prior to treatment, a lower result on a subsequent test indicates a response to treatment, and an increasing value indicates possible recurrence.",
