  "description" : "Histology code 8020/3 is defined as “undifferentiated carcinoma.” In the AJCC 8th chapter for Esophagus, this histology code is further subdivided into squamous or glandular component, which are staged differently.  A schema discriminator is necessary to distinguish between these histologies so that the appropriate stage group table is used.",
