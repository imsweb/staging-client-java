  "description" : "Carbohydrate Antigen (CA) 19-9 Pretreatment Lab Value records the CA 19-9 value prior to treatment. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that has prognostic significance for pancreatic cancer.\n\nCA 19-9 is a sialylated Lewis A blood group antigen that is commonly expressed and shed in pancreatic and hepatobiliary disease and in many malignancies, thus is not tumor specific.  Preoperative CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic cancer patients correlate both with AJCC staging and resectability [NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2019 Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma].",
