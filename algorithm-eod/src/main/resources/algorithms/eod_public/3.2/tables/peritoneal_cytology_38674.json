  "description" : "Peritoneal cytology pertains to the results of cytologic examination for malignant cells performed on fluid that is obtained from the peritoneal cavity.\n\nPeritoneal cytology looks for malignant cells in the fluid in the pelvic and peritoneal cavities.  Excess natural fluid accumulation is called ascites.  If, at laparotomy an analyzable amount of ascites is not present, the surgeon may flood the pelvis and abdomen with saline solution then suction it out and send the fluid for cytologic examination.",

The introduction of fluid may be termed peritoneal or pelvic washing or peritoneal lavage",
