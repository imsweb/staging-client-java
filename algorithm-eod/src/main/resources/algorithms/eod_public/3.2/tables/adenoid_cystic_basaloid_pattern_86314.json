  "description" : "Adenoid Cystic Basaloid Pattern, the presence of a basaloid pattern on pathological examination, is a prognostic factor for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland.\n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ICD-O-3 morphology code 8200/3) is the most common malignant epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a tumor composed of modified myoepithelial and ductal differentiated cells. A genetic alteration (i.e., fusion oncogene MYB-NFIB) is found in the majority of adenoid cystic carcinomas There are three histologic patterns within the adenoid cystic carcinoma group: cribriform, solid, and tubular.",
