  "description" : "This data item describes the status of femoral-inguinal lymph nodes associated with certain female genital cancers.\n\nIn addition to assigning the N categories for vulva, vagina, and cervical cancers, the collection of specific lymph nodes and how they were assessed is important.\n* Status refers to positive or negative involvement\n* Assessment is the method by which the nodal status was determined\n\nThere are 3 related data items that collect status information on regional lymph nodes, 1 data item for distant lymph nodes, and 1 data item for laterality. \n\nThe LN status data items collect the individual status (positive, negative, unknown) involvement of femoral-inguinal, para-aortic, and pelvic lymph nodes, and distant lymph nodes mediastinal and scalene. These related data items include \n\n* 3957: LN Status: Pelvic\n* 3958: LN Status: Para-Aortic\n* 3959: LN Status: Femoral-Inguinal\n* 3875: LN Distant: Mediastinal, Scalene",
