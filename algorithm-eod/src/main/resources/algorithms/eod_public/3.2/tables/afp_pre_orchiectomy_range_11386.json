  "description" : "AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Pre-Orchiectomy Range identifies the range category of the highest AFP value measured prior to treatment.  AFP is a serum tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis.\n\nFor Testis, there are 4 related data items that record information on AFP for Testis.\n* 3805: AFP Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3806: AFP Post-Orchiectomy Range\n* 3807: AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3808: AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Range",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of the AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Pre-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Timing** \n* Record the range of the highest AFP test result documented in the medical record **prior to orchiectomy** or prior to any systemic treatment. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Related data item** \n* The same laboratory test should be used to record the related data item 3807: AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value.",
