When the actual recurrence score is not available, there is an option for coding recurrence scores stated as less than 11 or greater than equal to 11 as this the cut point determined to be clinically relevant for stage group in AJCC8. Oncotype DX Risk Level -Invasive, coded in NAACCR Data Item #3906, stratifies the Oncotype DX recurrence score into three risk levels \n* **Low risk: Recurrence Score result less than 18:** The patient has a lower risk of having a recurrence, assuming 5 years of hormonal therapy is given. Chemotherapy is likely to have little or no benefit.\n* **Intermediate Risk:  Recurrence Score result between 18 and 30:** The patient has a tumor that is in the middle of the risk spectrum reflecting that biology is continuous and not all patients have a low or a high recurrence risk, assuming 5 years of hormonal therapy is given. The likelihood of distant recurrence and benefit from chemotherapy increases with an increase in the Recurrence Score result.\n* **High risk:  Recurrence Score result greater than or equal to 31:** The patient has a high risk of distant recurrence, assuming 5 years of hormonal therapy and is likely to benefit from\n.",
