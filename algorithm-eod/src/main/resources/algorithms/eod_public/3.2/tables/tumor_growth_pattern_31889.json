  "description" : "Tumor Growth Pattern refers to the growth pattern of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nThe tumor growth patterns of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include the mass forming type, the periductal infiltrating type, and a mixed type. \n* **Periductal infiltrating type** (20%): spreads along the duct in a diffuse manner that may be associated with poorer prognosis. This type of cholangiocarcinoma demonstrates a diffuse longitudinal growth pattern along the bile duct. Limited analyses suggest that the diffuse periductal infiltrating type is associated with a poor prognosis.\n* **Mass-forming** (60% of intrahepatic bile duct cases), which grows outward (radially) from the duct and invades the liver parenchyma in a well-defined mass.",
