  "description" : "AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Post-Orchiectomy Range identifies the range category of the lowest AFP value measured post-orchiectomy.  AFP is a serum tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. The Post-Orchiectomy lab value is used to monitor response to therapy.\n\nFor Testis, there are 4 related data items that record information on AFP for Testis.\n* 3805: AFP Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3806: AFP Post-Orchiectomy Range\n* 3807: AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3808: AFP Pre-Orchiectomy Range",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of the AFP (Alpha Fetoprotein) Post-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Timing** \n* Record the range of the AFP test as documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Lab values elevated after orchiectomy** \n* If the initial post-orchiectomy AFP remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest AFP value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again.\n\n**Note 4:** **Pre-orchiectomy AFP normal** \n* If the pre-orchiectomy AFP was normal, a post-orchiectomy AFP may not be performed. In this case, code 5 should be recorded.\n\n**Note 5:** **Related data item** \n* The same laboratory test should be used to record the related data item 3805: AFP Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value.",
