  "notes" : "This data items provides information related to the quality of care and describes the clinical outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. This data item provides prognostically relevant information by quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression. Therefore, this item can provide a better risk stratification for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, this data item can contribute to assessments of cancer care quality.\n\nThis data item records the clinical outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy as determined by the managing physician (oncologic surgeon, radiation oncologist or medical oncologist).\n\nFor the purposes of this data item, neoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine / hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy given to shrink a tumor before surgical resection.\n\nSee the [SEER Coding Manual](https://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2023/SPCSM_2023_MainDoc.pdf) for additional information.",
