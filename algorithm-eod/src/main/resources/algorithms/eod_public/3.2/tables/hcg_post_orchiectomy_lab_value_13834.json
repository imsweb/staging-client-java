  "description" : "hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value refers to the lowest hCG value measured post-orchiectomy.  hCG is a serum tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. The Post-Orchiectomy lab value is used to monitor response to therapy.\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta and some germ cell tumors. Two subunits, alpha and beta, can be measured in blood or serum. The alpha subunit is a non-specific marker for pancreatic and pituitary tumors. Beta-hCG levels are never found in normal healthy men. When the presence of beta-hCG is detected in serum, it always indicates a malignancy. Beta-hCG is secreted by some non- seminomatous germ cell tumors and mixed tumors and is used with AFP to identify the specific cell type of testicular cancer. Beta-hCG is also useful in monitoring response to therapy. After orchiectomy, the hCG should be undetectable within 5 to 8 days. If elevated hCG persists, this is an indication of residual tumor.\n\nFor Testis, there are 4 related data items that record information on hCG.\n* 3846: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3847: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Range\n* 3848: hCG Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3849: hCG Pre-Orchiectomy Range",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of the hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Timing** \n* Record the value of the hCG test as documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Lab values elevated after orchiectomy** \n* If the initial post-orchiectomy hCG remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest hCG value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again.\n\n**Note 4:** **Related Data Item** \n* The same laboratory test should be used to record the related data item 3847: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Range.",
