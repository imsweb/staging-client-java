  "description" : "O6-Methylguanine-Methyltransferase (MGMT) is an enzyme in cells that repairs DNA. Methylation of the MGMT gene reduces production of the MGMT enzyme and the ability of tumor cells to repair damage caused by chemotherapy.  Methylation of MGMT is a prognostic and predictive factor for high grade gliomas.\n\nO6-Methylguanine-Methyltransferase (MGMT) is an enzyme in cells that repairs DNA. DNA repair is undesirable in tumors, because it may enable them to overcome the DNA damage done by chemotherapy. With methylation, less MGMT enzyme is produced, which may lead to prolonged survival compared to unmethylated MGMT.\n\nA patient with increased MGMT methylation is more likely to respond to alkylating agents such as temozolomide (Temodar) and the nitrosoureas, some of the few drugs effective for brain tumors. MGMT methylation is a special (not routine) molecular test done on tumor tissue. It is used primarily for anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme, but can also be done for low grade malignant central nervous system tumors.",
