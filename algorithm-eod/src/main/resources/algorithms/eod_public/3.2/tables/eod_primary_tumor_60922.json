  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Benign/borderline tumors** \n* Benign (/0) or Borderline (/1) tumors **are always coded to 050** regardless of size, extension to adjacent sites, or multiple tumors. \n  * **Note:** Benign (/0) or Borderline (/1) Medulloblastoma's are very rare.\n\n**Note 2:** **Single tumors** \n* For invasive tumors, EOD Primary tumor is coded only for **single tumors confined to the primary site** (see code 150) or a **single** tumor crossing the midline without extension to adjacent structures (see code 250).\n   * Code 999 if there are multiple tumors in the brain\n  * The presence of multiple tumors is recorded in EOD Mets\n\n**Note 3:** **Midline shift** \n* A midline shift is not the same thing as crossing the midline\n  * Code 250 if you have a single tumor confined to the primary site with a midline shift that is not extending into adjacent structures (see Note 4). \n\n**Note 4:** **Types of extension coded in EOD Mets** \n* Direct or contiguous extension to an adjacent site is collected in EOD Mets. \n  * If the only information available is extension to an adjacent site, code EOD Primary Tumor 999 and assign the appropriate EOD Mets code\n* The following are collected in EOD Mets (see code 25 for all except circulating cells in CSF (code 15))\n  * Adjacent connective/soft tissue\n  * Adjacent muscle\n  * Bone\n  * Circulating cells in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)\n  * Major blood vessel(s)\n  * Meninges (e.g.; dura)\n  * Multiple/multifocal tumors\n  * Nerves (cranial, NOS)\n  * Ventricular system",
