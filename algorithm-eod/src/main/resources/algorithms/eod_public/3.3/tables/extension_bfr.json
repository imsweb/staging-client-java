  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Uveal Melanomas** \n* Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris. \n* Melanomas of the iris tend to be small, and those arising from or extending to the ciliary body typically are large.\n\n**Note 2:** **Discrete tumor nodules** \n* Discrete tumor deposit(s) in the orbit that are not contiguous to the eye are recorded in lymph nodes (See EOD Regional Nodes).",
