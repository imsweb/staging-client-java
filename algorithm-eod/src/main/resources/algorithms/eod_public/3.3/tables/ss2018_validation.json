Any other vertebral segments involved (non-adjacent) would be regional (code 2). \n  * Body (left)\n  * Body (right)\n  * Pedicle (left)\n  * Pedicle (right)\n  * Posterior element\n\n**Note 6:** **Pelvic tumors**\n* For the pelvic tumors (C414), both the number of pelvic segments involved by the primary tumor and the presence or absence of extraosseous extension determine the correct Summary Stage 2018 for localized and regional pelvic bone primaries. The four pelvic segments used in these codes are: \n  * Acetabulum\n  * Iliac wing\n  * Pubic ramus/Symphysis/Ischium\n  * Sacrum\n\n**Note 7:** **Definition of Regional lymph nodes**\n* Regional lymph nodes are defined as those in the vicinity of the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 8:** **Lymph node involvement in bone is rare**\n* Regional lymph node involvement is rare. \n* If there is no mention of lymph node involvement clinically, assume that lymph nodes are negative.",
