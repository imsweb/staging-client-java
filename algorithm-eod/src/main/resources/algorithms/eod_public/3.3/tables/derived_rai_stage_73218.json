  "description" : "This data item stores the Derived Rai stage value derived from the values coded in the following related data items for the Lymphoma-CLL/SLL schema (9823/3). \n\nPer confirmation from medical oncologists, Rai stage is only recorded for patients who have bone marrow and/or peripheral blood involvement. Per the Hematopoietic Rules, primary site would be C421 (See [Hematopoietic Manual](https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/heme/Hematopoietic_Instructions_and_Rules.pdf), Module 3: Rules PH 5, 6). Use code 5 for the 5 SSDIs when primary site is not C421.\n\nThe Rai classification system is now used to stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (9823/3) when bone marrow and/or peripheral blood are involved using several different criteria. The stages are based on the absence or presence of the following related data items. \n * 3885: Lymphocytosis\n * 3804: Adenopathy\n * 3907: Organomegaly\n * 3811: Anemia\n * 3933: Thrombocytopenia\n\n**Note: All of these data items are required for Staging for the AJCC Staging System Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (9823/3 only) and EOD.**\n\nRai stages \n * Stage 0 CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis (>15,000/mm3) without adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia\n * Stage I CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia\n * Stage II CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis with either hepatomegaly or splenomegaly with or without lymphadenopathy\n * Stage III CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly\n * Stage IV CLL is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm3) with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or anemia\n\nThis table below* can be used when the **ONLY** information available is the documented Rai stage from the managing physician. (Note: The Rai stage cannot be found on a pathology report).\n\n***Please see the Site-Specific Data Item (SSDI) Manual for the table.**",
