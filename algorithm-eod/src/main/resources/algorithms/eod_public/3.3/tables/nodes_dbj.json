  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Regional nodes and nodes, NOS**  \n* Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n\n**No surgical resection**\n* Use **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 200, 300) when there is a clinical work up only and there is **NO surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision, or lymph node dissection done during the clinical work up.\n\n**Surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy**\n* Use **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (400, 500) when there is a **surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH\n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision done or lymph node dissection performed.\n\n**Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy**\n* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is equal to or greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment codes take priority. Otherwise, code the pathologic assessment.\n  * See ***EOD 2018 General Instructions*** for further instructions on coding cases with neoadjuvant therapy, https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/staging/eod/.\n\n**Note 3:** **Regional lymph nodes include**\n- Iliac, NOS\n    + External\n    + Internal (hypogastric, obturator)\n- Inguinal, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial [femoral] \n- Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Note 4:** **Lymph nodes, NOS** \n* Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
