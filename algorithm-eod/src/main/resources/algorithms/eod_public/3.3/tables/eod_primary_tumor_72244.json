  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **FIGO and extension information** \n* When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension information on the primary tumor are available, use the extension information to assign the code in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 2:** **STIC** \n* Code 050 is for the following in situ histology (behavior /2) only\n  - High-grade serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) (8441/2)\n\n**Note 3:** **Malignant ascites** \n* Tumors in codes 100-250 with malignant ascites are coded 300. \n  * Ascites, NOS should be excluded as a staging element\n\n**Note 4:** **Fallopian tube involvement** \n* If there is involvement of the fallopian tube with no further evidence of extension, and the physician verifies this is an ovary primary, code 400.\n\n**Note 5:** **Pelvic organs** \n* Both extension to and/or discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are included in code 450\n  - Adjacent (pelvic) peritoneum\n  - Bladder\n  - Bladder serosa\n  - Cul de sac (rectouterine pouch)\n  - Ligament(s) (broad, ovarian, round, suspensory)\n  - Mesosalpinx (Mesovarium) \n  - Parametrium\n  - Pelvic wall\n  - Rectosigmoid\n  - Rectum\n  - Sigmoid colon (including sigmoid mesentery)\n  - Ureter (pelvic portion)\n\n**Note 6:** **Peritoneal implants** \n* Peritoneal implants or peritoneal carcinomatosis may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding.\n  * Code 600, 650, or 700 based on microscopic or the macroscopic size\n* Extraperitoneal carcinomatosis are coded in EOD Mets (code 50)\n\n**Note 7:** **Location of peritoneal implants** \n* If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen and code appropriately. If the location of the implants is not specified, code 750.\n\n**Note 8:** **Abdominal organs** \n* Both extension to and/or discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs by way of peritoneal seeding or implants are included in codes 600-750\n  - Abdominal mesentery\n  - Diaphragm\n  - Gallbladder\n  - Intestine, large (except rectum, rectosigmoid and sigmoid colon)\n  - Kidneys\n  - Omentum (infracolic, NOS)\n  - Pancreas\n  - Pericolic gutter\n  - Peritoneum, NOS\n  - Small intestine\n  - Stomach\n  - Ureters (outside pelvis)\n\n**Note 9:** **Peritoneal surface of the liver** \n* Tumor limited to the peritoneal surface of the liver or splenic capsule is coded 700, regardless of the size (microscopic or macroscopic).\n   - Any **parenchymal** involvement of the liver or spleen is coded in EOD Mets (code 50)\n\n**Note 10:** **Benign/borderline tumors** \n* In some registries benign/borderline ovarian tumors are reportable by agreement. \n  * If the tumor being reported is benign or borderline, code 999.",
