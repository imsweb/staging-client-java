  "description" : "The Pons and other subsites of the Brain Stem have the same ICD-O topography code (C717), which is for subsites of the Brain Stem. Clinically, information regarding the Pons is very important, especially for pediatric cases. \n\nA data item is needed to distinguish between the Pons and all other subsites within the Brain Stem (C717). Code the site in which the tumor arose. \n* Review of radiology reports and physician’s notes are needed to determine the appropriate code. Needle biopsies and surgery are usually too dangerous for these types of tumors, so the best information will be available from radiology reports.",

  "rationale" : "The pons site is the third most common site for pediatric brain tumors and there is currently no way to identify tumors that occur in this site. Surgery is too dangerous for these types of tumors. Needle biopsies are also dangerous and extremely rare. Without pathology specimens, accurate histology is elusive making accurate incidence not possible. A cascade of implications results without accurate incidence including support for drug development."
