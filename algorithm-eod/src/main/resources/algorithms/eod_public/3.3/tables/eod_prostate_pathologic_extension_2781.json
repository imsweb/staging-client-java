  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Radical prostatectomy or autopsy results only** \n* Only use histologic information from a radical prostatectomy and/or autopsy in this field.  \n* Information from biopsy of extraprostatic sites is coded in EOD Primary Tumor.\n  * Code results from a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) or simple prostatectomy in EOD Primary Tumor\n\n**Note 2:** **No radical prostatectomy or autopsy** \n* Code 900 if there is no radical prostatectomy or autopsy performed within first course of treatment. (See also Note 9)\n  * A radical prostatectomy is defined as Surgery of Primary Site codes 50-70 (A500-A700)\n  * If Surgery of primary site is 00-30, 90, 99 (A000-A300, A900, A999) then code 900\n    * *Note:* Surgery of primary site can be 00 if an autopsy is done\n\n**Note 3:** **Criteria for data item** \n* Limit information in this field to first course of treatment in the absence of disease progression. \n\n**Note 4:** **Incidental finding** \n* When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), or an autopsy, use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found. \n\n**Note 5:** **Radical prostatectomy, no residual disease** \n* Code 300 when there is a microscopically confirmed clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer and the radical prostatectomy shows no residual disease\n\n**Note 6:** **Prostatic urethra** \n* Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the extension code. \n\n**Note 7:** **Frozen pelvis** \n* \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  \n* In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign this to code 700.\n\n**Note 8:** **No evidence of primary tumor** \n* Code 800 is only to be used when there is a clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer that has not been microscopically confirmed (i.e., diagnosed via imaging with bone mets) and a radical prostatectomy or autopsy is done and there is no evidence of primary tumor. \n\n**Note 9:** **Active surveillance, then Radical Prostatectomy** \n* Code 950 is used when first course of treatment is active surveillance, but a radical prostatectomy is done at a later date due to disease progression or the patient changed their mind. \n* When code 950 is used, code the following SSDIs as X9: Gleason Patterns Pathological, Gleason Score Pathological, and Gleason Tertiary\n\n**Note 10:** **Coding unknown** \n* Code 999 when\n  * Radical prostatectomy is performed, but there is no information on the extension\n  * Surgery of Primary Site is Prostatectomy, NOS (Surgery of Primary Site is 80)\n  * Unknown if surgery is done (Surgery of Primary Site is 99)",
