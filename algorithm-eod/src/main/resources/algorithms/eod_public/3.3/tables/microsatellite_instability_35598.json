  "description" : "The microsatellite instability (MSI) test is a genetic test performed on tumor tissue to look for differences in length of certain non-functioning sections of DNA. The differences are caused by problems with the genes that encode proteins that normally repair certain types of DNA damage. Knowing whether cancer is microsatellite instability high may help plan the best treatment\n\nMicrosatellites are short, repeated, sequences of DNA. Cancer cells that have large numbers of microsatellites that may have defects in the ability to correct mistakes that occur when DNA is copied in the cell. Microsatellite instability is found most often in colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer. It may also be found in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid.",
