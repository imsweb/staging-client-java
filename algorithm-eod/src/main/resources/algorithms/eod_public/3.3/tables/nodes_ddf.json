Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.\n\n**No surgical resection**\n* Use **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (100, 300) when there is a clinical work up only and there is **NO surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision, or lymph node dissection done during the clinical work up. \n\n**Surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy**\n* Use **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (200, 400, 500) when there is a **surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision done or lymph node dissection performed.\n\n**Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy**\n* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is equal to or greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment codes take priority. Otherwise, code the pathologic assessment. \n  * See ***EOD 2018 General Instructions*** for further instructions on coding cases with neoadjuvant therapy, https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/staging/eod/.\n \n**Note 3:** **Previous scrotal surgery and lymph nodes** \n* Involvement of inguinal, pelvic, or external iliac lymph nodes WITHOUT or unknown if previous scrotal or inguinal surgery prior to presentation of the testis tumor is coded in EOD Mets as distant lymph node involvement.\n\n**Note 4:** **Regional lymph nodes include**\n\nAortic, NOS\n- Lateral (lumbar)\n- Para-aortic\n- Periaortic\n- Preaortic \n- Retroaortic\n\nPericaval, NOS\n- Interaortocaval\n- Paracaval\n- Precaval\n- Retrocaval\n\nRetroperitoneal below the diaphragm or NOS\nSpermatic vein\n\nLymph nodes **WITH** previous scrotal or inguinal surgery\n- External iliac\n- Inguinal nodes, NOS\n    + Deep, NOS\n    + Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n    + Superficial (femoral)\n- Pelvic\n\n**Note 5:** **Lymph nodes, NOS** \n* Code 800 if regional lymph nodes are involved, but there is no indication which ones are involved.",
