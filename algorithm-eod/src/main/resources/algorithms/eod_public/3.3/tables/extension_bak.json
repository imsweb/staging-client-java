  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Dimpling, tethering** \n* Changes such as dimpling of the skin, tethering, and nipple retraction are caused by tension on Cooper's ligament(s), not by actual skin involvement. \n* They do not alter the classification.\n\n**Note 2:** **Clinical evidence ONLY descriptions** \n* Adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening are clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue; assign code 200 if that is the only information available.\n  * Do not use these descriptions for pathological assessment of the breast.\n\n**Note 3:** **Fixation, NOS**\n* **\"Fixation\", NOS** is involvement of pectoralis muscle; assign code 200.\n\n**Note 4:** **Inflammatory carcinoma**\n* Inflammatory carcinoma is a clinical diagnosis. It is defined as greater than 33% of a breast involved WITH erythema, edema, peau d'orange, or other terms describing skin changes. \n  * See codes **400 and 500** for descriptions of inflammation **WITHOUT** a diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma.\n  *  See code **600** for a diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma",
