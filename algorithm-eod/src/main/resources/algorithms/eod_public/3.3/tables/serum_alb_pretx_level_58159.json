  "description" : "Albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma.  Serum albumin pretreatment level is a prognostic factor for plasma cell myeloma.\n\nThe Revised International Staging System (R-ISS or RISS) is now used to stage plasma cell myeloma (9732/3), using several different criteria. The stages are based on the absence or presence of the following related criteria. \n* 3931: Serum Beta-2 Microglobulin Pretreatment Level\n* 3930: Serum Albumin Pretreatment Level\n* 3857: High Risk Cytogenetics\n* 3869: LDH Level\n\nRequired for Staging: The AJCC Staging System Plasma Cell Myeloma and Plasma Cell Disorders (9732/3 only) and EOD. \n* Note: R-ISS stage is not applicable for the descriptions of plasma multiple myeloma that are listed in the codes 1 and 9 in the SSDI Schema Discriminator 1: Plasma Cell Myeloma Terminology. If you have coded 1 or 9 for this Schema Discriminator, the four data items listed above are BLANK.\n\nThe R-ISS stages are\n* Stage I: Serum Beta-2-microglobulin <3.5 mg/L and serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL and no high-risk cytogenetics and Normal LDH\n* Stage II: Not R-ISS I or III\n* Stage III: Serum Beta-2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/L and high-risk cytogenetics and/or high LDH",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician statement**\n* Physician statement of Serum Albumin Pretreatment Level can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Pretreatment results only**\n* Record this data item based on a **blood test** performed at diagnosis (pre-treatment). Use the highest value available.\n   * The actual test may not state serum; however, as long as the test results are **based on blood (includes plasma)**, they can be used.\n   * Albumin results from a **urine test cannot be used** to code this data item.\n* To use the albumin test, **it must say \"Serum/Plasma/Blood.\"**\n\n**Note 3:** **Component of R-ISS Stage**\n* Serum albumin is part of the Revised International Staging (R-ISS). \n  * A lab value expressed in grams per liter (g/L) is 10 times the same value expressed in g/dL; therefore, the cut point of 3.5 g/dL is equivalent to 35 g/L.\n* Elevated serum albumin is defined by ≥3.5 g/dL.\n* Use the cut points listed in the table below regardless of the lab’s reference range.\n   * **Code 1** if physician states **RISS Stage 1** and there is no other information",
