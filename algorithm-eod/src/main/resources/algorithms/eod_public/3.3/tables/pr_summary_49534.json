  "description" : "Progesterone Receptor Summary is a summary of results from the progesterone receptor (PR) assay.\n\nEstrogen receptor (ER) positivity and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity are favorable prognostic factors in breast cancer, as well as endometrial carcinoma and meningioma. Positive results predict a favorable response to endocrine (hormonal) therapy. Combined ER and PR positivity is associated with increased response to antiestrogen therapies. \nThere are a variety of ways to report information on ER and PR results, but there is almost always a summary statement that the result is positive or negative.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of PR (Progesterone Receptor) Summary status can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **In-situ and Invasive components present**\n* If PR is positive on an in-situ component and PR is negative on all tested invasive components in the primary tumor, code PR as negative (code 0)\n* If in situ and invasive components present and PR only done on the in-situ component in the primary tumor, code unknown (code 9)\n\n**Note 3:** **Single tumor, multiple biopsies or surgical resection, different results**\n* Use the highest (positive versus negative)\n\n**Note 4:** **Multiple tumors, different results**\n* Code the results from the largest tumor size (determined either clinically or pathologically) when multiple tumors are present.\n  * Do not use specimen size to determine the largest tumor size\n\n**Note 5:** **Results from nodal or metastatic tissue**\n* May be used ONLY when there is no evidence of primary tumor\n  * **Note:** In-situ is evidence of primary tumor\n\n**Note 6:** **Neoadjuvant Therapy**\n* Record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n* If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no ER results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens\n\n**Note 7:** **Others tests for PR**\n* Do not use results from the following tests to record PR results\n  * MammaPrint\n  * EndoPredict\n  * PAM 50 (Prosigna)\n  * Any other test that records PR",
