  "description" : "Extranodal extension (ENE) is defined as “the extension of a nodal metastasis through the lymph node capsule into adjacent tissue” and is a prognostic factor for most head and neck tumors. This data item pertains to pathological staging extension.\n\nThe presence of extranodal extension (ENE) from regional lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in some cancers because these patients are rarely cured without some type of systemic chemotherapy or radiation. Extranodal extension is defined as metastatic tumor growing from within the lymph node outward through the lymph node capsule and into surrounding connective tissues. \n\n* \"A regional node extending into a distant structure or organ is categorized as ENE and is not recorded as distant metastatic disease.”\n\nThis data item is for ENE that is detected pathologically for head and neck primaries.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of extranodal extension (ENE) pathologically during a lymph node dissection or physician pathological stage indicating the absence or presence of ENE can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Pathological assessment criteria** \n* Code the status of ENE assessed on histopathologic examination of **surgically resected** involved regional lymph node(s) \n  * Includes presence of ENE in a sentinel lymph node.\n \n* Do not code ENE from a lymph node biopsy (FNA, core, incisional), or the absence of ENE from a sentinel\n\n**Note 3:** **Regional vs. distant lymph nodes**\n* Do not code ENE for any distant lymph nodes\n\n**Note 4:** **Minor and Major ENE**\n  * Minor ENE is defined as less than or equal to 2 mm\n  * Major ENE is defined as greater than 2 mm\n    * Matted lymph nodes and soft tissue metastasis are considered major ENE",
