In this situation, the Ki-67 alone is enough to code the grade (G1). \n* Grades 2 and 3, are either/or for Ki-67 and Mitotic Count. You do not need both the Ki-67 and Mitotic Count to assign grade 2 or 3.\n\n**Note 7:** Code 9 (unknown) when\n* Microscopic exam is done after neoadjuvant therapy and grade from the primary site is not documented\n* Microscopic exam is done after neoadjuvant therapy and there is no residual cancer\n* Grade checked “not applicable” on CAP Protocol (if available) and no other grade information is available",
