Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **Unnamed nodes** \n* **For Colon and Rectum ONLY**, any unnamed nodes that are removed with a colon or rectal resection are presumed to be regional pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes and are included in the EOD Regional Nodes code 300 (pericolic for sites C180 - C189, C199 and perirectal for sites C199 or C209). \n* This site-specific instruction applies only to colon and rectum tumors and was verified with subject matter experts.\n\n**Note 3:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.  \n\n**No surgical resection**\n* Use **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600) when there is a clinical work up only and there is **NO surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision, or lymph node dissection done during the clinical work up. \n\n**Surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy**\n* Use **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (300) when there is a **surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision done or lymph node dissection performed.\n\n**Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy**\n* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is equal to or greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment codes take priority. Otherwise, code the pathologic assessment. \n  * See ***EOD 2018 General Instructions*** for further instructions on coding cases with neoadjuvant therapy, https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/staging/eod/.\n\n**Note 4:** **Tumor Deposits** \n* Code 200 is defined as **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only. This is used when\n* Primary tumor or site surgically resected with\n  * Any positive microscopic examination of tumor deposits WITHOUT positive lymph nodes\n    * If there are also positive lymph nodes, code 300",
