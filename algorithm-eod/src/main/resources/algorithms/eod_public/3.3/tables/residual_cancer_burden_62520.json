  "description" : "Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) is a score that measures the amount of cancer remaining in the breast and the regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. The RCB score is based on 4 independent prognostic factors measuring the primary tumor bed and 2 independent factors measuring the lymph nodes. \n\nThe RCB score combines these 6 independently prognostic factors from the surgical specimen after neoadjuvant therapy into a single continuous score. This score is prognostic across breast cancer subtypes, different treatments, and within existing stage groups. \n\nThe independent prognostic factors include\n* Primary Tumor Bed\n  * Primary Tumor Bed area (measured in millimeters)\n    * Includes the largest two dimensions\n  * Overall Cancer Cellularity (as percentage of area)\n  * Percentage of cancer that is invasive disease\n  * Percentage of cancer that is in situ disease\n* Lymph nodes\n  * Number of positive lymph nodes\n  * Diameter of largest metastasis",
  "notes" : "***Any questions regarding this SSDI are to be posted in the AJCC CAnswer Forum***\n\n**Note 1:** **Effective years**\n* This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2026+. \n* For cases diagnosed 2018-2025, this SSDI must be blank.\n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for coding**\n* Neoadjuvant therapy **AND** a surgical resection must be done to determine score\n* Leave data item blank if neoadjuvant therapy and a surgical resection are not done\n\n**Note 3:** **CAP Protocol or Synoptic Pathology Report**\n* Only record the information from the CAP Protocol or synoptic pathology report.",

  "rationale" : "Neoadjuvant therapy is now standard of care for HER2+ and triple negative breast carcinoma. Quantification of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy determines further patient management in this setting. The Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) is the most validated measure of volume of residual disease post neoadjuvant for breast cancer and has prognostic value."
