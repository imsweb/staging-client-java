  "description" : "The microsatellite instability (MSI) test is a genetic test performed on tumor tissue to look for differences in length of certain non-functioning sections of DNA. The differences are caused by problems with the genes that encode proteins that normally repair certain types of DNA damage. Knowing whether cancer is microsatellite instability high may help plan the best treatment\n\nMicrosatellites are short, repeated, sequences of DNA. Cancer cells that have large numbers of microsatellites that may have defects in the ability to correct mistakes that occur when DNA is copied in the cell. Microsatellite instability is found most often in colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer. It may also be found in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid. \n\nHigh MSI, found in about 15% of colorectal carcinomas, is an adverse prognostic factor for colorectal carcinomas and predicts poor response to 5-FU chemotherapy (although the addition of oxaliplatin in FOLFOX regimens negates the adverse effects.  High MSI is a hallmark of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma, also known as Lynch syndrome.\n\nA high proportion of colon cancers arising in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (also known as Lynch syndrome) have high MSI and a smaller percentage of colon cancers not associated with Lynch syndrome have high MSI.   Patients with colon cancers with high MSI may be further tested to determine if they have HNPCC.  In addition, MSI is a useful prognostic marker in that patients with high MSI colon cancers have better response to surgery and survival.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement**\n* Physician statement of MSI can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Applicable stages**\n* MSI may be recorded for all stages; however, it is primarily performed for invasive neoplasms\n* For non-invasive neoplasms (behavior /2), code to 9 if no information available.\n\n**Note 3:** **Results from nodal or metastatic tissue**\n* Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used for Microsatellite Instability.",
