  "description" : "Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Range identifies the range category of the highest LDH value measured prior to treatment. LDH is a nonspecific marker for testicular cancer that is elevated in some germ cell tumors.  This data item refers to the Pre-Orchiectomy range.\n\nWhen cells (normal or tumor) are damaged or destroyed, an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is released into the bloodstream.  LDH is an indirect indication of possible tumor burden or damage to an organ, which may be caused by metastatic involvement of liver or lung, or a myocardial infarction.  The total LDH should be the test value that is coded, but there are five fractions of LDH that measure tissue specific cellular damage: LD1 and LD2:  heart, red blood cells and kidneys; LD3: lung; LD4 and LD5:  liver, skin, and skeletal muscles.  LDH is elevated in 60% of patients with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. LDH is not a screening test, nor is it diagnostic of melanoma, ocular adnexal lymphoma, or testicular cancer.\n\nFor testis, only the LDH Range is coded. LDH is non-specific for testicular cancer.  Although part of the criteria for the S category in the TNM system, LDH is not routinely performed unless the patient has evidence of bulky or distant disease.\nFor Testis, there are 2 related data items that record information on LDH.\n* 3867: LDH Post-Orchiectomy Range\n* 3868: LDH Pre-Orchiectomy Range",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of the LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) Pre-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Timing** \n* Record the range of the highest LDH test result documented in the medical record **prior to orchiectomy** or prior to any systemic treatment. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Calculating the upper limit** \n* To calculate whether the lab result is in a particular range, multiply the lab’s upper limit of normal (usually stated on the report) times the stated multiplier. If the test is elevated, determine whether it is less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (code 1), between 1.5 and 10 times the upper limit of normal (code 2), or more than 10 times the upper limit of normal (code 3). (*See coding guidelines for example*).\n\n**Note 4:** **LDH and Testis** \n* Of the three tumor markers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the least specific for testicular cancer. The magnitude of LDH elevation directly correlates with Testis tumor burden.",
