  "description" : "Multiple brain molecular markers have become standard pathology components necessary for diagnosis. This data item captures clinically important brain cancer subtypes identified by molecular markers that are not distinguishable by ICD-O-3 codes.\nIf a mutation or alteration is in the name of the histopathology, it is required for diagnosis as it helps distinguish among clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 \n\n* *IDH mutation status* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 **9400/3**, Diffuse astrocytoma and **9401/3**, Anaplastic astrocytoma.\n* *IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deletion* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 code **9450/3**, Oligodendroglioma and **9451/3**, Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.\n* *IDH-wildtype* distinguishes clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 **9400/3**, Diffuse astrocytoma, **9401/3**, Anaplastic astrocytoma and **9440/3**, Glioblastoma, Epithelioid glioblastoma and Glioblastoma, NOS (note that the new ICD-O-3 code **9445/3** applies to Glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; information regarding this subtype is not collected using this data item).\n* *SHH-activation and TP53-wildtype* distinguishes between clinically important subtypes within ICD-O-3 histology code **9471/3**, Medulloblastoma.\n* *C19MC alteration* status distinguishes a clinically important highly aggressive subtype within ICD-O-3 **9478/3**, Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes\n* *Pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas*: **9385/3** Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3-G34-mutant, Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, Diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype, and Infant-type hemispheric glioma.\n* *Ependymal tumors* are distinguished by mutations required for diagnosis among clinically important subtypes: **9396/3** Posterior fossa group A (PFA) ependymoma, Posterior fossa group B (PFB) ependymoma, Spinal ependymoma, MYCN-amplified, Supratentorial ependymoma, YAPI fusion-positive, and Supratentorial ependymoma, ZFTA fusion-positive.\n* *Pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas* are distinguished among subtypes by mutations required for diagnosis: **9421/1** Diffuse astrocytoma, MYB-or MYBL1-altered, Diffuse low-grade glioma, MAPK pathway-altered, and Pilocytic astrocytoma.\n* *Circumscribed astrocytic tumors* are distinguished among subtypes by mutations required for diagnosis: **9430/3** Astroblastoma, MN1-altered and Astroblastoma.\n* *Other CNS embryonal tumors* are distinguished among subtypes by mutations required for diagnosis: **9500/3** CNS neuroblastoma, FOXR2-activated, CNS tumor with BCOR internal tandem duplication, and Neuroblastoma, NOS.",
