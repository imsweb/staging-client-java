  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Clark Level versus pathological description** \n* If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathological description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 2:** **Code greatest extent** \n* Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  \n* For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II, code 300 (Clark level IV).\n\n**Note 3:** **Satellite lesions/nodules** \n* Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in EOD Regional Nodes.\n\n**Note 4:** **Breslow's depth only available** \n* If a Breslow’s depth is given in the pathology report and there is **no other indication of involvement**, the following guidelines may be used (***Note:** If a physician documents a different Clark's Level then provided by these guidelines, go with the physician's Clark Level*)\n  * Code 000: Level I (In situ)\n  * Code 100: Level II (< 0.75 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n  * Code 200: Level III (0.76 mm to 1.50 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n  * Code 300: Level IV (> 1.50 mm Breslow’s Depth)\n\n**Note 5:** **Additional data items for staging** \n* In addition to EOD Primary Tumor, the following data items are also collected to determine the extent of the primary tumor:\n  - *Breslow's Thickness* [NAACCR Data Item #3817] and \n  - *Ulceration* [NAACCR Data Item #3936]",
