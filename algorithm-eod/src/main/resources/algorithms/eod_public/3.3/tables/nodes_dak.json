  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Regional nodes and nodes, NOS**  \n* Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in EOD Mets.\n\n**Note 2:** **Hepatoduodenal and Pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes** \n* Per AJCC, Hepatoduodenal nodes are regional for **all subsites** of the stomach. Previously they were regional only for the lesser curvature and the greater curvature.\n\n**Note 3:** **Metastatic nodules in the fat** \n* Metastatic nodules in the fat adjacent to a gastric carcinoma, without evidence of residual lymph node tissue, are classified as regional node metastases, but nodules implanted on peritoneal surfaces are classified as distant metastases (see EOD Mets).\n\n**Note 4:** **CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL codes** \n* This schema has lymph node codes that are defined as **CLINICAL** assessment only or **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only.  \n\n**No surgical resection**\n* Use **CLINICAL** assessment only codes (400, 450, 500, 600, 700) when there is a clinical work up only and there is **NO surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision, or lymph node dissection done during the clinical work up. \n\n**Surgical resection without neoadjuvant therapy**\n* Use **PATHOLOGICAL** assessment only codes (300) when there is a **surgical resection of the primary tumor or site** WITH \n  * Any microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes, which includes FNA, core biopsy, sentinel node biopsy, lymph node excision done or lymph node dissection performed.\n\n**Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy**\n* If patient has neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical assessment is equal to or greater than the pathological assessment, then the clinical assessment codes take priority. Otherwise, code the pathologic assessment. \n  * See ***EOD 2018 General Instructions*** for further instructions on coding cases with neoadjuvant therapy, https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/staging/eod/.",
