  "description" : "Lymph Node Size records the largest diameter of any involved regional lymph node(s). Pathological measurement takes precedence over a clinical measurement for the same node.\n\nThis data item is used to code the size of involved lymph nodes and is recorded in millimeters.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of Lymph Nodes Size can be used to code this data item when no other information is available. \n\n**Note 2:** **Criteria for coding LN size** \n* The metric is the **size of the largest tumor deposit** in the lymph node, not the size of the overall lymph node that is involved.  \n* For larger nodes however, the size of the deposit becomes essentially the size of the overall lymph node as the nodes become almost entirely overtaken with tumor.  \n* Code the size of the largest deposit if pathology reports separately list the size of a deposit and the size of the overall lymph node that the deposit is involving.\n\n**Note 3:** **Clinical vs Pathological size** \n* Code the **clinical node size** when the largest involved node is not examined pathologically.\n* Code the **pathological node size** when the largest involved node (or same level) is examined clinically and pathologically, even if the pathological size is smaller.\n* Code the **size of the largest deposit** when the pathology report separately lists the size of a deposit and the size of the overall lymph node that the deposit is involving. \n  * ***Example:*** Clinical evaluation shows 1.5 cm (15 mm) Level II lymph node, pathological examination shows positive Level II node 1.3 cm (13 mm), with size of largest nodal deposit 1.3 mm\n   * Code 13.0.\n\n**Note 4:** **Regional vs. distant nodes**\n* Do not code the size of any distant nodes.",
