  "description" : "Staging for oropharyngeal cancers changed in the AJCC 8th edition. Oropharynx was divided into **Oropharynx HPV-Associated (p16+)** and **Oropharynx HPV-Independent (p16-).** A schema discriminator is necessary to determine the HPV status so that the appropriate protocol/schema is used.\n\nThere are several methods for determination of HPV status. The most frequent, and preferred test is IHC for p16 expression, which is a surrogate marker for transcriptionally active high-risk HPV\n* Other tests that may be used for this data item **in addition to p16 or when p16 is not available** include (but are not limited to)\n  * High-risk HPV RNA ISH\n  * High-risk HPV DNA ISH\n* Other tests that may be used for this data item **in addition to p16 include** but are not limited to\n  * High-risk HPV DNA PCR\n\n**High-risk** HPV types include: 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 34, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73, and 82.\n\n**Low-risk (cannot be used to determine HPV status)** HPV types include: 6, 11, 42, 43, and 44.",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Schema discriminator for Oropharynx** \n* A schema discriminator is used to discriminate between oropharyngeal tumors that are p16 positive and oropharyngeal tumors that are p16 negative OR p16 status unknown. \n\n**Note 2:** **p16 testing** \n* p16 testing will guide classification of most patients but some will have HPV-specific testing that should be used in conjunction for classification when the pathologist performs it.\n\n* **00100: Oropharynx HPV-Associated (p16+) (see code 2)**\n     * p16 positive and it is the only test performed\n     * p16 positive when subsequent high-risk HPV-specific testing is performed and is positive\n     * p16 equivocal (50-70% staining) when subsequent high-risk HPV-specific testing is performed and is positive\n     * p16 not performed but when high-risk HPV-specific testing is positive (High-risk HPV RNA ISH or high-risk HPV DNA ISH when performed alone). \n       * High-risk HPV DNA PCR testing if used alone is not reliable to assign HPV status.\n     * Stated as **HPV-associated** or **High-risk HPV**\n\n* **00111: Oropharynx HPV-Independent (p16-) (see code 1)**\n   * p16 negative and it is the only test performed\n   * p16 expression of limited (<50%) distribution only \n   * p16 positive but when subsequent reliable high-risk HPV-specific testing is performed and is negative (reliable high-risk HPV-specific tests include high-risk HPV RNA ISH and high-risk HPV DNA PCR)\n   * Stated as **Oropharynx-Independent**\n\n* **HPV testing not done or unknown if done (see code 9)**\n  * Cases coded as unknown will be included with the Oropharynx HPV-Independent (p16-) schema\n  * Stated as **HPV positive** and no indication if itâ€™s p16, low risk or high risk\n  * Stated as **low risk HPV**",
