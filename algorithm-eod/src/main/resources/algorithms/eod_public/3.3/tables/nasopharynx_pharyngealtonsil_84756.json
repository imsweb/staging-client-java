  "description" : "Nasopharynx and pharyngeal tonsil have the same ICD-O topography code (C111). However, for purposes of stage grouping AJCC 8th edition, nasopharynx and pharyngeal tonsil are staged in different chapters. A schema discriminator is necessary to distinguish between these primary sites so that the appropriate chapter/schema is used.\n\n**Note: This schema discriminator is only needed for diagnosis years 2018-2024.  It should be left blank for diagnosis years 2025 and after.**",
