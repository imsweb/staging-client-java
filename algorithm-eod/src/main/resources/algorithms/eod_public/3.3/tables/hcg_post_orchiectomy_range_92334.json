  "description" : "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Post-Orchiectomy Range identifies the range category of the lowest hCG value measured post-orchiectomy.  hCG is a serum tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. The post-orchiectomy lab value is used to monitor response to therapy.\n\nFor Testis, there are 4 related data items that record information on hCG.\n* 3846: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3847: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Range\n* 3848: hCG Pre-Orchiectomy Lab Value\n* 3849: hCG Pre-Orchiectomy Range",
  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **Physician Statement** \n* Physician statement of the hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Post-Orchiectomy Range can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** **Timing** \n* Record the range of the hCG test as documented in the medical record **after orchiectomy** but prior to adjuvant therapy. The lab value may be documented in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** **Lab values elevated after orchiectomy** \n* If the initial post-orchiectomy hCG remains elevated, review subsequent tests and record the lowest hCG value (normalization or plateau) prior to adjuvant therapy or before the value rises again.\n\n**Note 4:** **Pre-orchiectomy hCG normal** \n* If the pre-orchiectomy hCG was normal, a post-orchiectomy hCG may not be performed. In this case, code 5 should be recorded.\n\n**Note 5:** **Related Data Item** \n* The same laboratory test should be used to record the related data item 3846: hCG Post-Orchiectomy Lab Value.",

  "rationale" : "hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) is a Registry Data Collection Variable in AJCC. hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Post-orchiectomy Range is used to assign the S Category Pathological and was previously collected as Testis CS SSF #15."
