  "notes" : "**Note 1:** **GIST tumors in the Digestive System** \n* For GIST tumors arising in the tubular organs of the digestive system (Esophagus, Stomach, Small Intestine, Appendix, Colon and Rectum), any extension beyond the muscular wall (e.g. invasion beyond the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS) into adjacent tissues, sites or organs is no longer confined to the site of origin (EOD Primary Tumor code 100). \n  * Extension through the wall, NOS, or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS without further extension would be EOD Primary Tumor code 100 (confined to the site of origin).\n  * Extension through the wall, NOS or through the muscularis propria/muscularis, NOS with any further extension into underlying tissues/fat, organs or structures would be included in EOD Primary Tumor codes 400 or 700 (Adjacent (connective) tissue, NOS or Extension to organs/structures, NOS).\n\n**Note:** **EOD references** \n See the schema corresponding to the primary site for information about the site's anatomy. \n* The corresponding schema can be used to help determine what the adjacent (connective) tissues, structures or organs are, but the site-specific schema codes are not to be used to determine whether a GIST tumor is localized, regional or distant.\n* See the chapter (schema) corresponding to the primary site for information about extension. \n* *For example*: For primary colon GIST, see the colon chapter (schema) for extension information.\n  * **Esophagus**: C150-C155, C158-C159\n  * **Small Intestine**: C170-C172, C178-C17\n  * **Stomach**: C160-C166, C168-C169 \n  * **Appendix**: C181 \n  * **Colon and Rectum**: C180, C182-C189, C199, C209\n  * **Retroperitoneum**: C480-C482, C488\n\n**Note 3:** **Retroperitoneum GIST** \n* For GIST tumors arising in the Retroperitoneum (C480-C482, C488), refer to the EOD General Instructions for the definition of adjacent (connective) tissue. \n* Refer to the General Instructions to determine whether the GIST tumor involves adjacent tissues or is confined to the primary site.",
