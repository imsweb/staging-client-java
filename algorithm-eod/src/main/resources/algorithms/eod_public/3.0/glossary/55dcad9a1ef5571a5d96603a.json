  "name" : "Pancoast tumor",
  "definition" : "The designation of 'Pancoast' tumor relates to the symptom complex or syndrome caused by a tumor arising in the superior sulcus of the lung that involves the inferior branches of the brachial plexus (C8 and/or T1) and, in some cases, the stellate ganglion. Some superior sulcus tumors are more anteriorly located, and cause fewer neurological symptoms but encase the subclavian vessels. The extent of disease varies in these tumors, and they should be classified according to the established rules. \n\nIf there is evidence of invasion of the vertebral body or spinal canal, encasement of the subclavian vessels or unequivocal involvement of the superior branches of the brachial plexus (C8 or above), the tumor is then classified as T4. If no criteria for T4 disease is present, the tumor is classified as T3. ",
