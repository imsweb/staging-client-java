The LDH must be taken prior to systemic (chemo, immunotherapy, hormone), radiation therapy or surgery to a metastatic site. The lab value may be recorded in a lab report, history and physical, or clinical statement in the pathology report.\n\n**Note 3:** Upper limits of normal for LDH vary widely depending on the lab. Common upper limits can be 200, 250, 618, or other values. \n\n**Note 4:** The same laboratory test should be used to record information in 3932:LDH Lab Value and 3869: LDH Level.",
