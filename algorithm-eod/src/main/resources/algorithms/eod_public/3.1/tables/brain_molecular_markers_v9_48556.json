  "notes" : "**Note 1:** This data item was introduced in 2018 and applied to the following ICD-O-3 histology codes 9400/3, 9401/3, 9440/3, 9450/3, 9451/3, 9471/3, 9478/3\n* These are codes 01-09 and are applicable for cases diagnosed 2018+ and are in ICD-O-3 order\n\n**Note 2:** In 2022, the 5th edition of the CNS WHO Blue Book was released and the following histologies were added 9385/3, 9396/3, 9421/1, 9430/3, 9500/3\n* These are codes 10-23 and are applicable for cases diagnosed 2024+ and are in ICD-O-3 order\n\n**Note 3:** If a microscopically confirmed histology is not included in this list, assign, code 85. \n* If your case is not microscopically confirmed, code 99\n\n**Note 4:** Physician statement of histologic subtype can be used to code this data item. \n\n**Note 5:** See Brain Molecular Markers in the SSDI Manual, in the *Definition* section for more information on the different histologies. \n\n***Examples:***\n1.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Diffuse Astrocytoma (9400/3). Additional testing done, and IDH-mutant is identified. Code 01.\n2.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Anaplastic astrocytoma (9401/3). No further testing or results unknown. Code 99.\n3.\tMRI of brain tumor, clinical diagnosis: glioblastoma.  No further workup.  Code 99.\n4.\tBiopsy of brain tumor, microscopic confirmation diagnosis: Mixed glioma (9382/3). Code 85.",
