  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of Extranodal Extension (ENE) Pathological or physician pathological staging can be used to code this data item when there is no other information available.\n\n**Note 2:** Extranodal extension is defined as \"the extension of a nodal metastasis through the lymph node capsule into adjacent tissue.\" ENE is the preferred terminology. Other names include: extranodal spread, extracapsular extension, or extracapsular spread.\"  \n* \"A regional node extending into a distant structure or organ is categorized as ENE and is not recorded as distant metastatic disease.\" \n\n**Note 3:** Be aware that the rules for coding ENE for head and neck sites compared to non-head and neck sites are different.\n\n**Note 4:** Code the status of extranodal extension assessed on the **surgical resection** specimen for the most involved regional lymph node(s). Do not code ENE for any distant lymph nodes. Code the status of ENE based on the following criteria\n* Code 0\n  * Absence of ENE, positive lymph nodes assessed by lymph node dissection\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 3-7\n* Code 1\n  * Presence of ENE assessed by Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy\n  * Presence of ENE assessed by lymph node dissection\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 2-7\n* Code 7\n  * Lymph nodes negative for cancer assessed by Sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection\n  * 1292: Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery must be 2-7\n* Code 9\n   * Absence of ENE, positive lymph nodes assessed by Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy\n     * A positive Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy cannot assess the absence of ENE, only the presence of it. This is because there is not enough surrounding tissue in a Sentinel Lymph node biopsy to accurately assess ENE\n\n* If codes 1 or 7 are used, this indicates that the lymph nodes were surgically resected or a Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy was done and Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery [NAACCR Data Item: 1292] must be 2-7",
