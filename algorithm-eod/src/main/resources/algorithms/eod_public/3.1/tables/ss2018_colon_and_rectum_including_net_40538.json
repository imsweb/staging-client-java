Used with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**Note 2:** See the following chapters for the listed histologies \n* 8710-8714, 8800-8934, 8940-9138, 9141-9582: *Soft Tissue*\n* 8935-8936: *GIST*\n* 9140: *Kaposi Sarcoma*\n* 9700-9701: *Mycosis Fungoides*\n\n**Note 3:**  Code 0 (behavior code 2) includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial), or described as in situ. \n\n**Note 4:** For the following, AJCC 8th edition stages these as in situ tumors. SS2018 stages these as localized (behavior code 3)\n* Intramucosal, NOS\n* Lamina propria\n* Mucosa, NOS\n* Confined to, but not through muscularis mucosa\n\n**Note 5:** Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 6:** The colon and rectum may be entirely peritonealized, partially peritonealized, or non-peritonealized. Use this list to help distinguish between localized and regional Tumors (See Note 7).\n* Entirely peritonealized segments: Cecum, Transverse colon, Sigmoid colon, Rectosigmoid colon\n* Segmental surfaces that are peritonealized: Anterior and lateral surfaces of: Ascending colon, Descending colon, Hepatic flexure, Splenic flexure, Upper third of rectum. Anterior surface: Middle third of rectum.\n* Entirely non-peritonealized segment: Lower third of rectum\n* Segmental surfaces that are non-peritonealized: Posterior surface of: Ascending colon, Descending colon, Hepatic flexure, Splenic flexure, Upper two-thirds of rectum\n\n**Note 7:** Invasion into “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” can be either localized (code 1) or regional (code 2), depending on the primary site and whether it is peritonealized (fully or partially) or not. When extension is described as “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue”\n* Localized may NOT be used for entirely peritonealized sites (cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid colon), as this would be equivalent to peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissue invasion (regional, code 2)\n* Localized may ONLY be used for peritonealized sites (See Note 6) when the extension is described using other terms listed under localized (code 1) (ex. subserosal fat). If there are no other terms used to describe the extension, other than invasion of “pericolorectal tissue”, then assign regional (code 2) \n* For partially peritonealized sites (See Note 6), “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” may indicate invasion of either non-peritonealized (localized, code 1) or peritonealized tissue (regional, code 2)\n  * Check for mention of serosa/peritoneum in the operative report and/or pathology report final diagnosis or gross description to determine the correct code. Again, if other descriptions besides “pericolonic/pericolorectal tissue” are used, assign localized (code 1) or regional (code 2) based on the terminology used\n* If the pathologist does not further describe the “pericolic/perirectal tissues” as either “non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” vs “peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues” and the operative report and/or gross description does not describe the tumor relation to the serosa/peritoneal surface, and it cannot be determined whether the tumor arises in a peritonealized portion of the colon, code localized (code 1).\n\n**Note 8:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is coded as regional (code 2) or distant (code 7). However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be coded to localized (code 1) or regional (code 2).\n\n**Note 9:** Tumors characterized by involvement of the serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) by direct extension or perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal surface through inflammation are coded to regional (code 2).",
