Only code FIGO stage in this field, do not code FIGO grade.\n* Code FIGO grade in the grade fields\n\n**Note 3:** If there is more than one FIGO stage provided from the clinical and pathological work up, code the most extensive FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 4:** For Endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) (8380/2) and Serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (SEIC) (8441/2), assign the FIGO staged based on the managing physician's documentation of FIGO. (See Note 1)\n* If FIGO stage for EIC or SEIC is not documented by the managing physician, code unknown (code 99)\n* Do not code 97 (in situ) for EIC or SEIC since FIGO does not have a Stage 0\n* If diagnosis is Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) (8380/2), code 97.\n\n**Note 5:** Code 97 for any remaining in situ histologies (/2) since the FIGO stage definitions do not include Stage 0.",
