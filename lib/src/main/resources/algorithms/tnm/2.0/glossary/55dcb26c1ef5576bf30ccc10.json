  "name" : "Isolated tumor cells",
  "definition" : "Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are single tumor cells or small clusters of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest extent that can be detected by routine H and E stains or immuno-histochemistry. An additional criterion has been proposed to include a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in a single histological cross-section. The same applies to cases with findings suggestive of tumor cells or their components by non-morphological techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. \n\nITCs do not typically show evidence of metastatic activity (e.g. proliferation or stromal reaction) or penetration of lymphatic sinus walls. \n\n",
