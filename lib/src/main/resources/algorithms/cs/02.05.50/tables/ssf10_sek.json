  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Of the three tumor markers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the least specific for testicular cancer and is more of a determinant of bulky or disseminated disease. Although recommended to be tested, LDH may not be routinely performed, especially if the primary is localized.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the range of the LDH test as documented in the patient record prior to orchiectomy and other treatment.  \n\n**Note 3**:  If the pre-orchiectomy LDH test is unavailable but a physician's statement of the result is documented, use codes 991-993.\n\n**Note 4**:  For rare cases that are treated prior to orchiectomy, use code 995 in this field and record the initial LDH range in CS Site-Specific Factor 16.\n\n**Note 5**:  For rare cases that an orchiectomy is not performed, use code 996 in this field and record the initial LDH range in CS Site-Specific Factor 16.",
