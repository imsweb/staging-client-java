  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in CS Mets at DX. \n\n**Note 2**:  According to AJCC, p. 325, \"There is no lower threshold of tumor burden defining the presence of regional nodal metastasis. Specifically, nodal tumor deposits less than 0.2 millimeter (mm) in diameter (previously used as the threshold for defining nodal metastasis), are included in the staging of nodal disease as a result of the consensus that smaller volumes of metastatic tumor are still clinically significant\".  This means that any finding of melanoma in lymph nodes, regardless of size and including isolated tumor cells (ITCs), should be coded as positive lymph nodes in this field.  If only ITCs are present, use code 010. \n\n**Note 3**:  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are considered regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed. \n\n**Note 4**:  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for AJCC staging but may be distant for Summary Stage.  Use code 115 for involvement of nodes in secondary nodal basins not specified in codes 100 and 110. \n\n**Note 5**:  Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in this field. Use codes 100-118 if there is regional node involvement without satellite nodules or in-transit metastases.  Use codes 140-151 if there are satellite nodules or in-transit metastases but there is either no regional lymph node involvement, or involvement of regional nodes is not stated.  Use codes 200-223 if both satellite nodules/in-transit metastases and regional lymph nodes are present. \n\n**Note 6**:  If the only information about lymph nodes is a statement of N1 involvement without a clinical or pathologic designation, use code 125.\nIf the only information about lymph nodes is a statement of N2 involvement without a clinical or pathologic designation, use code 155.",
