  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code the Gleason's primary and secondary patterns from needle core biopsy or TURP only in this field. Gleason's primary and secondary patterns provided on prostate tissue on a transurethral resection of bladder (TURB) specimen can also be used in this field.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code the Gleason's primary and secondary patterns prior to neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n**Note 3**:  Usually prostate cancers are graded using Gleason's score or pattern.  Gleason's grading for prostate primaries is based on a 5-component system (5 histologic patterns).  Prostatic cancer generally shows two main histologic patterns.  The primary pattern, the pattern occupying greater than 50% of the cancer, is usually indicated by the first number of the Gleason's grade, and the secondary pattern is usually indicated by the second number.  These two numbers are added together to create a pattern score, ranging from 2 to 10.  \n\n* If there are two numbers, assume that they refer to two patterns (the first number being the primary pattern and the second number the secondary pattern), and sum them to obtain the score.\n* If only one number is given and it is less than or equal to 5, assume that it describes a pattern.  Code the number as the primary pattern and code the secondary pattern as 9.   \n* If only one number is given and it is greater than 5, assume that it is a score.  Code 099.  \n* If the pathology report specifies a specific number out of a total of 10, the first number given is the score.  Example:  The pathology report says Gleason's 3/10.  The Gleason's score would be 3, and coded as 099.\n\n**Note 4**:  If different patterns are documented on multiple needle core biopsies code the pattern that reflects the highest or most aggressive score regardless if the pathologist provides an overall pattern in a final summary.  If different patterns equal the same high score, give priority to the highest primary pattern and then the highest secondary pattern.  For example, both Gleason's 3, 4 and Gleason's 4, 3 equal Gleason's score 7; code 043. Do not mix patterns from multiple specimens.\n\n**Note 5**:  If needle core biopsy and TURP are both performed, code the pattern that reflects the highest score.\n\n**Note 6**:  If needle core biopsy and TURP are not performed, use code 998. If the Gleason's pattern and score are not documented on needle core biopsy or TURP, use code 999.",
