  "notes" : "**Note 1**: This CS Site-Specific Factor is collected for cases diagnosed through 12/31/2009. It is not required by any standard setter for cases diagnosed 01/01/2010 forward; use code 988.\n\n**Note 2**: Apex involvement was considered in prostate stage classification in the SEER Historic Local/Regional/Distant staging system, although it is not a staging element in AJCC 6 or 7  staging.  This item allows collection of information about the involvement of the prostate apex with cancer, both clinically and at prostatectomy, useful for long-term trend analysis of SEER data for prostate anatomic stage.\n\n**Note 3**: Cancers arising in the apex were localized, and cancers extending to the prostatic apex were regional in Historic staging.  The code digits 3 and 4, described in Note 4, provide specific information about involvement of apex for Historic stage, while the code digit 2 indicates apex involvement but does not distinguish between arising in and extending to.\n\n**Note 4**: In codes 110-550, the first digit represents the clinical status of apex involvement found on needle core biopsy, imaging or physical examination. The second digit represents apex involvement found at prostatectomy. The third digit is always 0.\n\n         _____                      _____                     __0__\n     Clinical Apex              Pathologic Apex             Always \"0\"\n      Involvement                 Involvement\n\nThe digits are defined as follows:\n\n      1 - No involvement of prostatic apex:\n          statement of normal apex\n          negative apex involvement (i.e., needle biopsy indicates both apices negative, \n            prostatectomy indicates malignancy only in lobes/base)\n      2 - Into prostatic apex/arising in prostatic apex, NOS\n          Note: Avoid using this code if more detailed information is available to use 3 or 4 (see Note 3)\n      3 - Arising in prostatic apex\n          apex is only site of malignancy\n      4 - Extension into prostatic apex\n          involvement of apex AND other part(s) of prostate\n          statement indicating malignancy started in other part(s) of prostate and extends into apex \n      5 - Apex extension unknown\n          no description of apex involvement\n          always 2nd digit when prostatectomy not performed\n\n**Note 5**: Code apex involvement if clearly documented in the medical record.  Try to determine if the cancer has extended into the apex from another part of the prostate or has arisen in the apex.  If apex involvement is unknown both clinically and pathologically, use code 550.",
