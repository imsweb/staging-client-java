  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The mitotic count reflects the potential aggressiveness or prognosis of endocrine pancreatic tumors.  This site-specific factor presumes the denominator of 10 high power fields (HPF) or its equivalent, so just the numerator (the mitotic count) is coded here.  For other schemas in which mitotic count is collected, the denominator may vary.  An HPF usually has a magnification objective of 40 (a 40x field). \n\n**Note 2**:  Record mitotic count, to the nearest tenth of a mitosis, as documented in the pathology report.  For example, a mitotic count of 6/10 HPF.\n\n**Note 3**:  Code the specific mitotic count only per 10 HPF; assume the denominator is 10 HPF if not specified.  Use code 996 only if the mitotic count is expressed with a specific denominator other than 10 HPF.\n\n**Note 4**:  Although mitotic count is generally documented for neuroendocrine tumors, if the mitotic count is available for a non-endocrine tumor, code the count. If it is not available (endocrine or non-endocrine tumor), code 999.",
