  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The International Prognostic Score (IPS) has been developed for Hodgkin lymphoma and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors:  \n\n* Male sex\n* Age 45 years or greater\n* Ann Arbor Stage IV \n* Serum albumin less than 4 grams/deciliter (g/dl)\n* Hemoglobin concentration less than 10.5 g/dl\n* White blood cell count greater than or equal to 15,000/cubic millimeter (mm)\n* Lymphocytopenia, lymphocyte count less than 600/cubic mm or less than 8% of white cell count\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the IPS score as documented in the medical record.  Do not calculate points. Only record points if a physician has documented them.\n\n**Note 3**:  There are now three indices/scores associated with lymphoma: The International Prognostic Index (IPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 3), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 4) and the International Prognostic Score (for Hodgkin lymphomas, CS Site-Specific Factor 5.) Physicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably. For coding:\n\n* Score identified:  Value in appropriate CS SSF, 999 in other two CS SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less:  999 in all three CS SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 6or 7:  Value in CS SSF 5 (IPS), 999 in other two CS SSF.",
