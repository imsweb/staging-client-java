  "notes" : "**Note 1**: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been developed for lymphomas and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 60 years \n* Ann Arbor Stage III or IV\n* More than 1 extranodal site involved \n* Patient's performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) 2, 3, or 4\n* Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level\n\n**Note 2**: Record the IPI as stated in the medical record. Do not calculate points or assign risk. Only record points or risk if a physician has documented them. Use points over risk if both are available.\n\n**Note 3**: There are now three indices/scores associated with lymphoma: The International Prognostic Index (IPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 3), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 4), and the International Prognostic Score (IPS) (for Hodgkin lymphomas, CS Site-Specific Factor 5).   Physicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably. For coding:\n\n* Score identified:  Value in appropriate CS SSF, 999 in other two CS SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less:  999 in all three CS SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 6 or 7:  Value in CS SSF 5 (IPS), 999 in other two CS SSF.",
