  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The Follicular Lymphoma Prognostic Index (FLIPI) has been developed for follicular lymphomas and predicts outcome based on the following adverse factors: \n\n* Age more than 60 years       \n* Ann Arbor Stage III or IV\n* More than 4 nodal areas involved\n* Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase LDH level\n* Serum hemoglobin concentration less than 12 grams/deciliter (g/dl)\n\n**Note 2**:  Record the FLIPI as documented in the medical record.   Do not  calculate points or assign risk. Only record points or risk if a physician has documented them. Use points over risk if both are available.\n\n**Note 3**:  There are now two indices/scores associated with lymphoma: The International Prognostic Index (IPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 3) and the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI, CS Site-Specific Factor 4). Physicians may use these indices/scores interchangeably.  For coding:\n\n* Score identified:  Value in appropriate CS SSF, 999 in other CS SSF\n* Score not identified, point value 5 or less:  999 in both CS SSF",
