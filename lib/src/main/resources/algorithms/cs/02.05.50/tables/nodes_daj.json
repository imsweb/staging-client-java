  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes such as cervical (excluding supraclavicular) or contralateral axillary are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 2**:  Micrometastases are defined as tumor deposits greater than 0.2 millimeter (mm) but not greater than 2.0 mm in largest dimension.  Macrometastases are tumor deposits greater than 2.0 mm.  All nodes with at least micrometastases are included in the count of positive lymph nodes, but at least one node must contain a macrometastasis for assignment of a pathologic N category greater than pN1mi.\n\n**Note 3**:  If the pathology report indicates that nodes are positive but size of the metastases is not stated, assume the metastases are greater than 0.2 mm and code the lymph nodes as positive in this field.  Use code 600 in the absence of other information about regional nodes.\n\n**Note 4**:  In a physical exam if palpable nodes are not described as fixed or matted, assume that nodes are movable.\n\n**Note 5**:  Codes 130-600 refer to level I and level II ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes and ipsilateral intramammary nodes only.  Ipsilateral level III axillary lymph nodes, which are also known as infraclavicular or apical nodes, are coded 750 or higher.  Axillary lymph nodes do not include internal mammary or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 6**:  For the breast schema, the choice of the N category is dependent on the CS Lymph Nodes Eval field.  There are certain CS Lymph Nodes codes that can only be used if the nodes are evaluated clinically (CS Lymph Nodes Eval is coded 0, 1, 5, or 9), which will be designated as \"Evaluated clinically:\" at the beginning of the code description.  Similarly, there are certain CS Lymph Nodes codes that can only be used if the nodes are evaluated pathologically (CS Lymph Nodes Eval is coded 2, 3, 6, or 8), and these will be designated as \"Evaluated pathologically:\".  All other codes can be used for clinical or pathologic evaluation.\n\n**Note 7**:  Isolated tumor cells (ITC) are defined as single tumor cells or small clusters not greater than 0.2 mm, usually detected only by immunohistochemical (IHC) or molecular methods but which may be verified on hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stains.  ITCs do not usually show evidence of malignant activity (e.g., proliferation or stromal reaction). Lymph nodes with ITCs only are not considered positive lymph nodes.  If the record only states N0(i+), code to 000 and see CS Site-Specific Factor 4.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Lymph Nodes code 000 ONLY, the N category is assigned based on the coding of CS Site-Specific Factors 4 and 5 using the IHC MOL Table for this schema.\n- For CS Lymph Nodes codes 250, 258, 260, 510, 520, 600, 610, 620, 630, 720, and 748 ONLY, the N category is assigned based on the values of CS Lymph Nodes Eval and CS Site-Specific Factor 3 (Number of Positive Ipsilateral Axillary Lymph Nodes). If the CS Lymph Nodes Eval code is 2 (p), 3 (p), 6 (yp), or 8 (a), the N category is determined by reference to the Lymph Nodes Pathologic Evaluation Table. If the CS Lymph Nodes Eval code is 0 (c), 1(c), 5(c), or 9 (c), the N category is determined by reference to the Lymph Nodes Clinical Evaluation Table. If the CS Lymph Nodes Eval field is not coded, the N category is determined by reference to the Lymph Nodes Positive Axillary Node Table.\n- For CS Lymph Nodes code 000 ONLY, the N category is assigned based on the coding of CS Site-Specific Factors 4 and 5 using the IHC MOL Table for this schema.\n- For CS Lymph Nodes codes 250,258, 260, 280, 500, 510, 520, 600, 610, 620, 630, 720, and 748 ONLY, the N category is assigned based on the values of CS Lymph Nodes Eval and CS Site-Specific Factor 3 (Number of Positive Ipsilateral Axillary Lymph Nodes).
