  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a numerical scale used to determine how urgently a patient with liver disease needs a liver transplant within the next three months.  Results from three routine lab tests are used to calculate the MELD score.  Creatinine, one of the tests, measures kidney function; impaired kidney function is often associated with severe liver disease.\n\n**Note 2**:  Normal values may vary from lab to lab. The typical human reference ranges are 0.5 to 1.0 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl) (about 45-90 micromoles/liter (umol/l) for women and 0.7 to 1.2 mg/dl (60-110 umol/l) for men.\n\n**Note 3**:  Record the blood or serum creatinine value for this data item\n\n**Note 4**:  Record to the nearest tenth in mg/dl or umol/l the highest creatinine value prior to treatment. Record a creatinine value of 0.53 mg/dL as 005; record a value of 60 umol/l as 600; and record a value of 110 umol/l as 980.\n\n**Note 5**:  Record the creatinine unit of measure for the same laboratory test in CS Site-Specific Factor 5.\n\n**Note 6**:  Use code 997 ff the test was done but the actual value is not statedUse code 997 If the test was done but the unit is not in mg/dl or umol/l.",
