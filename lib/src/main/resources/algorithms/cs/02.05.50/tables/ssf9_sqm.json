  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  The mitotic count, the number of mitoses per 40 high-power fields (HPF), reflects the potential aggressiveness or prognosis of uveal melanomas.  This site-specific factor presumes the denominator of 40 HPF, so just the numerator (the mitotic count) is coded here.  For other schemas in which mitotic count is collected, the denominator may vary.\n\n**Note 2**:  An HPF usually has a magnification objective of 40 (a 40x field).  As described in the AJCC chapter on uveal melanomas, the typical field area is 0.15-0.19 square millimeters (mm).\n\n**Note 3**:  Record mitotic count to the nearest tenth as documented in the pathology report.  For example, a mitotic count of 6/40 HPF would be coded 060.\n\n**Note 4**:  Code the specific mitotic count only per 40 HPF; assume the denominator is 40 HPF if not specified.  Use code 996 only if the mitotic count is expressed with a specific denominator other than 40 HPF.",
