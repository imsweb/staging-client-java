The presence of nuclear NM23 protein may be a good marker for predicting the metastatic potential of certain tumors. The value is expressed as the percentage of carcinoma cells in the tissue sample with positive nuclear staining for the NM23 protein.\n\n**Note 2**:  Record whether nuclear NM23 staining is present as stated on the test report.",
