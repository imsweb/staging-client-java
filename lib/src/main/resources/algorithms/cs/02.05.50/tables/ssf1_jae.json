CA-125 is a tumor marker or biomarker that may be elevated in the blood of some patients with ovarian cancer. \n\n**Note 2**:  Record only the blood or serum CA-125 value for this data item.  Do not record CA-125 test results based on fluid from the chest or abdominal cavity. \n\n**Note 3**:  Record the CA-125 status  prior to treatment. \n\n**Note 4**:  Normal values may vary with patient age and from lab to lab. The typical human reference ranges are 0 to 35 micrograms per milliliter (ug/ml).",
