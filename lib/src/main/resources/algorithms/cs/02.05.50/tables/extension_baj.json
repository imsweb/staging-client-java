  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Direct extension to or other involvement of structures considered M1 in AJCC staging is coded in the data item CS Mets at DX. This includes:  sternum; skeletal muscle; skin of chest; contralateral lung or mainstem bronchus; separate tumor nodule(s) in contralateral lung.\n\n**Note 2**:  Distance from Carina:  Assume tumor is greater than or equal to 2 centimeters (cm) from carina if lobectomy, segmental resection, or wedge resection is done.\n\n**Note 3**:  Opposite Lung:  If no mention is made of the opposite lung on a chest x-ray, assume it is not involved. \n\n**Note 4**:  Bronchopneumonia:  Bronchopneumonia is not the same thing as obstructive pneumonitis and should not be coded as such.  Bronchopneumonia is an acute inflammation of the walls of the bronchioles, usually a result of spread of infection from the upper to the lower respiratory tract.  Obstructive pneumonitis is a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucous plugging, and parenchymal inflammation that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion.\n\n**Note 5**:  Pulmonary Artery/Vein:  An involved pulmonary artery/vein in the mediastinum is coded to 700 (involvement of major blood vessel).  However, if the involvement of the artery/vein appears to be only within lung tissue and not in the mediastinum, it is not coded to 700.\n\n**Note 6**:  Vocal cord paralysis (resulting from involvement of recurrent branch of the vagus nerve), superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor or to lymph node involvement.  The treatment options and prognosis associated with these manifestations of disease extent fall within the T4-Stage IIIB category; therefore, generally use code 700 for these manifestations.  However, if the primary tumor is peripheral and clearly unrelated to vocal cord paralysis, SVC obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, code these manifestations as mediastinal lymph node involvement (code 200) in CS Lymph Nodes, unless there is a statement of involvement by direct extension from the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 7**:  Pleural effusion and pericardial effusion are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 8**:  In some cases, the determination of the T category for TNM 6 or 7 staging is based on this field, CS Tumor Size, CS Mets at DX, and CS Site-Specific Factor 1.\n\n**Note 9**:  Code to the highest applicable code for CS Extension and then code the absence or presence of separate ipsilateral tumor nodules in CS Site-Specific Factor 1, Separate Tumor Nodules/Ipsilateral lung. Code separate tumor nodules in contralateral lung in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 10**: Specific information about visceral pleura invasion is captured in codes 410-430 and CS Site-Specific Factor 2, Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI)/Elastic Layer.  Elastic layer involvement has prognostic significance for lung cancer.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 000-440, 455-520, 540-600, 730, and 950-999, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on the values of CS Tumor Size, CS Extension, and CS Site Specific Factor 1, as shown in the Size Extension AJCC 7 Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 000-999, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the values of CS Tumor Size, CS Extension, CS Mets at Dx and CS Site Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Size Extension Mets AJCC 6 Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 000, 950, 980 and 999, Summary Stage 77 is assigned based on the values of CS Extension and Site Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Summary Stage 77 Table for this schema.\n- For CS Extension codes 000-700, 740, 950-999, Summary Stage 2000 is assigned based on the values of CS Extension and Site Specific Factor 1 as shown in the Summary Stage 2000 Table for this schema.",
