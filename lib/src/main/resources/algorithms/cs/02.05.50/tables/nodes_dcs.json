  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  For head and neck schemas, this field includes all lymph nodes defined as Levels I-VII and Other by AJCC.  The complete definitions are provided in the General Rules, Section 2.\n\n**Note 2**:  For head and neck schemas, additional information about lymph nodes (size of involved nodes, extracapsular extension, levels involved, and location of involved nodes above or below the lower border of the cricoid cartilage) is coded in CS Site-Specific Factors 1, 3-9.\n\n**Note 3**:  If laterality of lymph nodes is not specified, assume nodes are ipsilateral.  Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral.\n\n**Note 4**:  For head and neck cancers, if lymph nodes are described only as \"supraclavicular\", try to determine if they are in Level IV (deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in the lower jugular chain) or Level V (in the posterior triangle, inferior to the transverse cervical artery) and code appropriately.  If the specific level cannot be determined, consider them as Level V nodes.\n\n**Note 5**:  Level IV nodes have been moved from code 100 in CS Version 1 to code 120.  Mandibular nodes are included with Facial nodes.",
