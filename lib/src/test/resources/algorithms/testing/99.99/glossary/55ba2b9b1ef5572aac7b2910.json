  "name": "Masticator space",
  "definition": "This is the lateral anatomical region below the middle cranial fossa and is defined by distinct fascial planes. The main fascial boundary is related to the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. This is also known as investing fascia. The investing fascia is formed when the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia splits at the lower margin of the body of the mandible and rises to enclose the muscles of mastication. \n\nMedially, the fascia combines with another fascia, the interpterygoid fascia, and then rises up to the skull base. Laterally, the fascia rises up above the level of the zygomatic arch and covers the temporalis muscle. The zygomatic arch is used to subdivide the MS into a suprazygomatic MS (portion above the zygomatic arch) and the nasopharyngeal MS (portion below the level of the zygomatic arch). \n\nThe contents of the MS include the mandibular division of the fifth cranial nerve, the muscles of mastication, sections of the internal maxillary artery, the pterygoid plexus and the ramus and coronoid of the mandible.
