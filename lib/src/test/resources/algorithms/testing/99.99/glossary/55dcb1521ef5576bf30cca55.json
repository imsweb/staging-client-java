  "name": "Tumor deposits",
  "definition": "Tumor deposits (satellites), i.e. macro- or microscopic nests or nodules, in the lymph drainage area of a primary carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule, may represent discontinuous spread (classified in the T category), venous invasion (V1/V2) or a totally replaced lymph node. If a nodule is considered by the pathological to be a totally replaced lymph node (generally having a smooth contour), it should be recorded as a positive lymph node, and each such nodule should be counted separately as a lymph node in the final pN determination.
